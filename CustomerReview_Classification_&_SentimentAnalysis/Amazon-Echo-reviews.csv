This is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of  my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves.  This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.Voice Recognition:At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with  Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration.  Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.Setting up the devices and Grouping:Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy  have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.Bottom line, if you  are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!-Picard, out. Hailing frequencies closed.

I have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he’s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don’t have something that is compatible or doesn’t have Bluetooth or wifi etc… as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it’s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you’re not there!!I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it’s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don’t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That’s like half price and why I hadn’t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don’t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don’t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it’s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That’s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we’ll that I can talk to my son when he’s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there’s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!There’s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you’re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn’t even imagine.So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don’t even have to talk. It’ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!

A friend of mine recently gave me an echo. 2nd Gen. And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.But for now I'm very fond of this deviceOther cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.The speaker is pretty darn decent.I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.By the way for a little fun ask her to Beam me up Scottie. Just be careful of the tribbles.

I have had homepod mini, the original homepod, and most of the Echo first party devices, including echo studio. The echo 4th gen is definitely the best of all of these. I have even owned the bose portable, some really expensive Sony speakers. For the size and sound quality and reliable and fast voice recognition, these can't be beat.Issues with the homepods:The homepod had great sound quality, but it was big and you still dont get the stereo separation effect you can get with two speakers one on each side of the room, and after a firmware update the speaker developed a weird and terrible sounding issue and I had to throw it away. Apple discontinued it so I couldn't buy a replacement. The homepod minis used to be good, in fact better sound quality than probably the echo dot 5th gen (I didn't test it personally, just heard the sound in a review). However they started becoming unreliable as well, one would cut out midsong or there would be a weird echoing effect and the voice recognition was always slower than an echo device. And sometimes siri wouldn't recognize at all, or she would say 'something went wrong, this is taking longer than I expected'.... a lot.So switching over to two Echo 4th gens, in a stereo pair, was really great because the voice recognition is faster and she usually understands what I say and play it. I could say the same request to both and Siri wouldn't get it while Alexa would.However there was a major issue, at first they wouldn't pair in a sound pair. I had to web search and find out that what you have to do is plug in one speaker only, say 'alexa check for updates' and then wait until that speaker updates, then unplug it, do that for the second speaker, unplug it when done, then update the alexa app on your phone, then plug everything back in and try to pair them again in the app. That worked for me. Amazon really dropped the ball on this, and I had to remove a star, you shouldn't get a product that has a basic feature like the speakers working in a stereo pair that requires a bunch of googling to solve. I can imagine the frustration if you buy two and then they don't work in a stereo pair and your googling skills aren't good enough. Another knock on Alexa compared to Siri in general, is that lately Alexa has been spamming me asking me if I want stuff. Siri never does that. Alexa will say things like 'by the way (advertisement, would you like to try it/buy it?) However as far as I know there is no reliable Apple smart speaker that exists so this is your best option. Note that I didnt try the google products because I gave up on google made products, they all seem to break (chromebook, pixel 6, google wifi, etc. and then google always makes some excuse why they wont fix it- so not only do their products break but they also won't fix them- I gave up on them)

The new Echo 4th Gen is a big change in aesthetics and design for the Echo line.  The new spherical shape is wider and shorter than previous Echo versions, and now focus sound in one primary direction instead of 360 degrees.  It adds an extra tweeter, and seems to produce more sound than previous versions.  Here are my early thoughts so far, after using it for about 24 hours:THE GOOD:Setup was incredibly simple.  I just powered the device on, and the Echo announced that it was ready for setup.  I opened the Alexa app on my phone, and the new Echo was automatically detected and set up instantly.  I didn't have to enter any information at all.  It can't get any easier than this.BETTER SOUND.  This new Echo has an extra tweeter, for a total of two 0.8 inch tweeters, and the same 3.0 inch Sub from the Gen 3 Echo.  This new Echo is designed with the tweeters pointed forward, and the speaker placement seems to generate more bass also somehow, even with the same Sub as the Gen 3.  All in all I think it sounds much better than Gen 3, with a little more bass and louder max volume.  This could also be do to the sound-mapping feature that allows Echo to maximize the sound by detecting the acoustics and shape of the room.  You can also pair two of these in stereo; and you are supposed to be able to use it as a speaker for your FireTV device, though I haven't tested that out yet.Temperature sensor included.  Yes, you can ask Alexa what the temperature is, and it seems very accurate so far.  This is a nice touch, and I look forward to doing more testing, to see if I can set up routines based on temperature.AZ1 Processor. This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses.  In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge.  This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus.  It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.THE BAD:No 360 degree speakers.  While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations.  It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.White power cord.  This is minor, but a strange choice.  No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white.  Some people might find that annoying.Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing.  This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience.  I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume.  This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.NEUTRAL: -Aesthetics.  I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape.  This is totally personal preference of course.  I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side.  Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade.  Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!

Bought 3 Echo Dots about 18 months ago.  Discovered a few months ago that I could use the Alexa app to group them so that I could stream synced music throughout the house. Found that I listened to music as I worked around the house, but that the music sound quality wasn't as good as I wanted.Bought 3 Echo 4th Gen w/Premium Sound, two of them on Black Friday for ~$50 each.  Very pleased with them. If you use an Echo to interact with Alexa or to stream spoken word (e.g., podcasts, news, audio books), I'd say an Echo Dot is sufficient. If, however, you stream music, consider spending a bit more to get the Echo 4th Gen w/ Premium Sound. The Dot has 1 speaker; the Echo 4th Gen has 3 speakers (woofer + 2 tweeters). The sound is noticeably richer.  The bass is cleaner  -- no rattling, thumping I sometimes get with the Echo Dot.I kept the Dots in the speaker group, but used the app to reduce the bass so there is no rattling/thumping when playing songs with hefty bass.  It's an inexpensive way to have good sounding music all over the house.

I purchased both an Echo Dot and an Echo and am very happy with both of them. I had wanted them for a long time, but had held off as it wasn’t a priority. Now that I have them I am quite pleased with my purchases.  I love that it can be requested to play music in different languages. My wife is Brazillion and speaks Portuguese as her primary language and English as her second language and she enjoys music from her country.  Alexa makes it so easy to play whatever she wants to listen to and I love the Alexa start my day messages with the weather. I also think it’s hilarious when you ask Alexa to tell you a joke, and she does.  I’m sure I’ll find many more uses over time for the devices but we are off to a great start so far.

I have 8 Echos in various rooms and from several generations. Yep, I have a big house... What attracted me to this generation was that onboard voice capabilities that makes response faster and sure, who doesn’t want even better sound quality? I also liked the design better than the looks of the previous generations and that I could see the activity ‘light ring’ when I was sitting down. The spherical designed has some real advantages and it’s apparent in the improved sound. And improved it is. Music is easily better, more complex and effortless. This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED ‘fake fire lights’), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I’ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it’s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here’s my line up:  Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it’s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there’s a series called “Hardcore History” with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What’s cool is I can start one of these while I’m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I’m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to “Play Hardcore History” it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There’s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime!  Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back!  Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, “Echo, repeat EVERYWHERE” and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: “Dinner is in 5 minutes!” So sweet!I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it’s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I’ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930’s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I’m such a fan!The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you’d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.LOVING this product and the direction it’s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I’m upgrading all along the way. I returned on for a discount and the other 1st gen is going to a charity raffle. And heck, it’s in perfect condition with all the original packaging and boxes.Hot Dog!-G

Love the echo. Speakers are great. I love that it works as a smart home hub, we just make sure all smart home products we buy work with Alexa.Wish that we were able to play music that is not on Amazon music (CDs, Apple Music, library audiobooks etc) but we’ve only found apps you can buy to help with that problem. We can use it as a Bluetooth speaker to play those other options, but it just doesn’t work as well as casting from the phone/app.We used to have a lot of problems with Alexa understanding what we were saying and the commands we were giving. After 6-9 months we reset all of our echo products and things have definitely been better. Not perfect but better. My only other complaint is that I can’t figure out the drop in feature. My guess is user error and I’m sure I’ll figure it out eventually. Overall, it’s great and makes our lives easier.

I was looking for a soundbar system for my livingroom. While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick. My Echo Sub arrived today, and I'm REALLY looking forward to trying that out.

This is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of  my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves.  This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.Voice Recognition:At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with  Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration.  Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.Setting up the devices and Grouping:Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy  have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.Bottom line, if you  are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!-Picard, out. Hailing frequencies closed.

I have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he’s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don’t have something that is compatible or doesn’t have Bluetooth or wifi etc… as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it’s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you’re not there!!I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it’s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don’t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That’s like half price and why I hadn’t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don’t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don’t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it’s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That’s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we’ll that I can talk to my son when he’s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there’s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!There’s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you’re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn’t even imagine.So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don’t even have to talk. It’ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!

A friend of mine recently gave me an echo. 2nd Gen. And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.But for now I'm very fond of this deviceOther cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.The speaker is pretty darn decent.I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.By the way for a little fun ask her to Beam me up Scottie. Just be careful of the tribbles.

I have had homepod mini, the original homepod, and most of the Echo first party devices, including echo studio. The echo 4th gen is definitely the best of all of these. I have even owned the bose portable, some really expensive Sony speakers. For the size and sound quality and reliable and fast voice recognition, these can't be beat.Issues with the homepods:The homepod had great sound quality, but it was big and you still dont get the stereo separation effect you can get with two speakers one on each side of the room, and after a firmware update the speaker developed a weird and terrible sounding issue and I had to throw it away. Apple discontinued it so I couldn't buy a replacement. The homepod minis used to be good, in fact better sound quality than probably the echo dot 5th gen (I didn't test it personally, just heard the sound in a review). However they started becoming unreliable as well, one would cut out midsong or there would be a weird echoing effect and the voice recognition was always slower than an echo device. And sometimes siri wouldn't recognize at all, or she would say 'something went wrong, this is taking longer than I expected'.... a lot.So switching over to two Echo 4th gens, in a stereo pair, was really great because the voice recognition is faster and she usually understands what I say and play it. I could say the same request to both and Siri wouldn't get it while Alexa would.However there was a major issue, at first they wouldn't pair in a sound pair. I had to web search and find out that what you have to do is plug in one speaker only, say 'alexa check for updates' and then wait until that speaker updates, then unplug it, do that for the second speaker, unplug it when done, then update the alexa app on your phone, then plug everything back in and try to pair them again in the app. That worked for me. Amazon really dropped the ball on this, and I had to remove a star, you shouldn't get a product that has a basic feature like the speakers working in a stereo pair that requires a bunch of googling to solve. I can imagine the frustration if you buy two and then they don't work in a stereo pair and your googling skills aren't good enough. Another knock on Alexa compared to Siri in general, is that lately Alexa has been spamming me asking me if I want stuff. Siri never does that. Alexa will say things like 'by the way (advertisement, would you like to try it/buy it?) However as far as I know there is no reliable Apple smart speaker that exists so this is your best option. Note that I didnt try the google products because I gave up on google made products, they all seem to break (chromebook, pixel 6, google wifi, etc. and then google always makes some excuse why they wont fix it- so not only do their products break but they also won't fix them- I gave up on them)

The new Echo 4th Gen is a big change in aesthetics and design for the Echo line.  The new spherical shape is wider and shorter than previous Echo versions, and now focus sound in one primary direction instead of 360 degrees.  It adds an extra tweeter, and seems to produce more sound than previous versions.  Here are my early thoughts so far, after using it for about 24 hours:THE GOOD:Setup was incredibly simple.  I just powered the device on, and the Echo announced that it was ready for setup.  I opened the Alexa app on my phone, and the new Echo was automatically detected and set up instantly.  I didn't have to enter any information at all.  It can't get any easier than this.BETTER SOUND.  This new Echo has an extra tweeter, for a total of two 0.8 inch tweeters, and the same 3.0 inch Sub from the Gen 3 Echo.  This new Echo is designed with the tweeters pointed forward, and the speaker placement seems to generate more bass also somehow, even with the same Sub as the Gen 3.  All in all I think it sounds much better than Gen 3, with a little more bass and louder max volume.  This could also be do to the sound-mapping feature that allows Echo to maximize the sound by detecting the acoustics and shape of the room.  You can also pair two of these in stereo; and you are supposed to be able to use it as a speaker for your FireTV device, though I haven't tested that out yet.Temperature sensor included.  Yes, you can ask Alexa what the temperature is, and it seems very accurate so far.  This is a nice touch, and I look forward to doing more testing, to see if I can set up routines based on temperature.AZ1 Processor. This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses.  In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge.  This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus.  It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.THE BAD:No 360 degree speakers.  While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations.  It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.White power cord.  This is minor, but a strange choice.  No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white.  Some people might find that annoying.Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing.  This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience.  I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume.  This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.NEUTRAL: -Aesthetics.  I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape.  This is totally personal preference of course.  I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side.  Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade.  Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!

Bought 3 Echo Dots about 18 months ago.  Discovered a few months ago that I could use the Alexa app to group them so that I could stream synced music throughout the house. Found that I listened to music as I worked around the house, but that the music sound quality wasn't as good as I wanted.Bought 3 Echo 4th Gen w/Premium Sound, two of them on Black Friday for ~$50 each.  Very pleased with them. If you use an Echo to interact with Alexa or to stream spoken word (e.g., podcasts, news, audio books), I'd say an Echo Dot is sufficient. If, however, you stream music, consider spending a bit more to get the Echo 4th Gen w/ Premium Sound. The Dot has 1 speaker; the Echo 4th Gen has 3 speakers (woofer + 2 tweeters). The sound is noticeably richer.  The bass is cleaner  -- no rattling, thumping I sometimes get with the Echo Dot.I kept the Dots in the speaker group, but used the app to reduce the bass so there is no rattling/thumping when playing songs with hefty bass.  It's an inexpensive way to have good sounding music all over the house.

I purchased both an Echo Dot and an Echo and am very happy with both of them. I had wanted them for a long time, but had held off as it wasn’t a priority. Now that I have them I am quite pleased with my purchases.  I love that it can be requested to play music in different languages. My wife is Brazillion and speaks Portuguese as her primary language and English as her second language and she enjoys music from her country.  Alexa makes it so easy to play whatever she wants to listen to and I love the Alexa start my day messages with the weather. I also think it’s hilarious when you ask Alexa to tell you a joke, and she does.  I’m sure I’ll find many more uses over time for the devices but we are off to a great start so far.

I have 8 Echos in various rooms and from several generations. Yep, I have a big house... What attracted me to this generation was that onboard voice capabilities that makes response faster and sure, who doesn’t want even better sound quality? I also liked the design better than the looks of the previous generations and that I could see the activity ‘light ring’ when I was sitting down. The spherical designed has some real advantages and it’s apparent in the improved sound. And improved it is. Music is easily better, more complex and effortless. This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED ‘fake fire lights’), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I’ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it’s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here’s my line up:  Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it’s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there’s a series called “Hardcore History” with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What’s cool is I can start one of these while I’m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I’m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to “Play Hardcore History” it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There’s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime!  Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back!  Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, “Echo, repeat EVERYWHERE” and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: “Dinner is in 5 minutes!” So sweet!I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it’s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I’ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930’s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I’m such a fan!The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you’d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.LOVING this product and the direction it’s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I’m upgrading all along the way. I returned on for a discount and the other 1st gen is going to a charity raffle. And heck, it’s in perfect condition with all the original packaging and boxes.Hot Dog!-G

Love the echo. Speakers are great. I love that it works as a smart home hub, we just make sure all smart home products we buy work with Alexa.Wish that we were able to play music that is not on Amazon music (CDs, Apple Music, library audiobooks etc) but we’ve only found apps you can buy to help with that problem. We can use it as a Bluetooth speaker to play those other options, but it just doesn’t work as well as casting from the phone/app.We used to have a lot of problems with Alexa understanding what we were saying and the commands we were giving. After 6-9 months we reset all of our echo products and things have definitely been better. Not perfect but better. My only other complaint is that I can’t figure out the drop in feature. My guess is user error and I’m sure I’ll figure it out eventually. Overall, it’s great and makes our lives easier.

I was looking for a soundbar system for my livingroom. While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick. My Echo Sub arrived today, and I'm REALLY looking forward to trying that out.

AFTER READING A FEW REVIEWS. THERE IS EITHER ALOT OF DEAF PEOPLE AROUND OR THEY JUST  CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD. I HAVE 3 OF THE 3RD GEN. 2 OF THE 5TH AND 4 OF THE 4TH GEN. ALL THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE AND IT SOUNDS AWESOME. ALL YOU DO IS TELL ALEXA PLAY THROUGHOUT HOUSE. AND YOU CAN ADJUST EACH UNIT BASS AND TREBLE AND MID RANGE BY TELLING EACH ONE TO ADD MORE BASS, TREBLE OR LESS ETC. THEN YOU WILL SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. THE 3 RD AND 5TH GEN. ARE GOOD DON'T GET ME WRONG FOR SUCH SMALL UNITS PRODUCING SUCH GOOD SOUND. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY ANYBODY SAYING THE 3RD & 5TH ARE BETTER SOUNDING THAN THE 4 TH YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETURN AND GET ANOTHER ONE. BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT LEMON.  (JUST SAYING.)

I have wanted an Echo Dot for a long time. I was hesitant to order because I am not at all tech savvy. The instructions were super easy to understand, once I downloaded the Alexa app on my iPhone 13, it became much simpler. I did get a little confused at one point. I called Amazon, and they immediately helped me resolve my issues. I am so happy with my new friend, Alexa. We are getting to know each other very well. This was one of the best purchases I have made for myself in a long while. One happy customer with this!

Bought these to setup an Alexa Home Theater with my 1st Gen Fire TV Cube. Must use Alexa App to set it up, but it worked flawlessly. Now when I am streaming on the Fire Cube, I have much better sound that the TV speakers.  Now I don't have to turn on the stereo and run HDMI video through the receiver to get great sound.  Alexa interactions seem to listen on both speakers but responses always come back to the left speaker. Seems a bit odd, but what the hey. It works.  No issues with audio sync, though there is a config that lets you adjust that. Very happy with the Home Theater pair.

I received this device on December 8.  I used this 4th generation Echo to replace a previous version.  Activation was smooth and uneventful.  HOWEVER, the audio was initially problematic . . .  dropping out periodically. Stopping.  At the suggestion of a user on Amazon Helps, I performed a software update on the Echo and ever since then it has worked flawlessly!I recommend that Amazon include instructions in the package on how to perform a software update (""Alexa, check for software updates.""} as soon as the device is activated.

Don't know why I waited so long to get one of these. Used the email link Amazon sent me for pre-setup, and all I had to do was plug it in when I received it and was good to go. Always thought people that had these were just lazy, but now I see what all the excitement is about. Linked to my Sirius/XM account and all I need to do is tell it what station to play - the sound is fantastic, and carries through my large family room and kitchen at only level 5. Can't wait to try it as a wake-up alarm and other things.

Years ago, I started with the Echo Dots.  The little hockey pucks.  Not used for music but for a virtual assistant, controlling smart lighting and also controlling my TV's Firestick that tunes over-the-air television through my Recast.  I loved it.  But then I got an Echo Show for the kitchen and I really enjoyed playing music on it while cooking.  The sound quality was ok.  Nothing to brag about.  Then I decided to upgrade my hockey pucks to the newer full size Echos.  I bought two Echos and placed one in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I would play music through them and the sound quality was very surprising.  So then I decided to get one more for the back porch.  That evolved into wanting another for the porch that I could pair to the other.That's when everything changed for me!  When you pair two of them together and set it up as a stereo pair; it is really amazing.  I sit outside now and I listen to music (in stereo!) on the porch.  The bass can be felt in my chair.  I'm so impressed.  I have 5 acres and with the volume turned up to 7, I can hear the music just about anywhere on my property.I plan on getting more Echos and enhancing the music when I listen to it inside the house.  I have the Bose 700 Soundbar and Subwoofer in my living room.  It sounds great for movies, TV and music.  But I prefer the Echos when listening to music.  Its perfect.  I can have Echos placed around the house and have music playing softly and you can hear it everywhere.I'm very impressed.

Some people find the spherical echos ugly--I do not. But the white power cord on the charcoal model is DEFINITELY UGLY. They can't afford to match the cord with the speaker, apparently.There's nothing wrong with the actual speaker, I'm just mad that the cord color is so lazy and very discretely advertised as being white because THEY KNOW IT IS UGLY. lmao1 star off for ugly, 1 star off for them trying to hide the color of the cord in the product pictures. My black/charcoal echo dot had a black cord, so I'm not sure why this one doesn't.I'll give it 1 star back because the quality and even the volume of the sound is definitely an upgrade from previous gens. I flat-out refuse to buy a black replacement cord if they try to release one for more money.

This was my second Echo.  I needed help connecting my first one to Wi-Fi  (I'm a mess when it comes to technology), but I've had no problems.  The one I just bought was for my upstairs bedroom.  I dreaded that there might be some connections I didn't know how to do, but it turned out that all I had to do was plug it into the wall socket.  Even I can do that!  It's got great sound.

I already had an echo, I added a sub about 3 months back and finally decided to add a second speaker for a stereo effect.I learned something that I wanted to share. After setting up the sub and now this second echo in a pairing configuration, know this:1. The speakers only play together when streaming content from the internet (Amazon music or if you have Apple Music linked to Alexa). If you try to pair your phone via Bluetooth and play, it will ONLY play through the single echo (no sub, no second echo)2. Pairing trick - immediately after setting up my sub or 2nd echo, I could not for the life of me, pair them to my existing echo. Apparently, you have to wait about 5-10mins before you can pair them together. I’m guessing it’s some discovery process so they can see each other on the local network. So if at first you can’t pair them, come back in 10 mins and try again.Otherwise, the sound is quite good for such a small speaker and I love the motion detection feature for automation.Hope this helps someone!

I ordered this as a second device to replace my ""hockey puck"" Alexa. I expected a small improvement but am amazed at the sound quality. You can control the equalizer by telling Alexa to raise or lower the bass, mid range and treble (Alexa set bass down to 4, set mid range up to 6) +6 or -6 settings for sound. The sound quality almost rivals my Bose and I am a finicky listener. We set it on the counter between the kitchen and living room to take advantage of the Omni directional sound. I understand that some folks are unhappy with it against a wall as they lose some sound quality so I do recommend setting it somewhere away from a wall. Oh, and with Alexa not hearing you.....if your volume is up pretty high you must shout. So, we found that if we manually turn the volume down Alexa can hear better and responds faster. Hope that helps.

I had the original dot paired with a larger samsung speaker about the size of the first echo “tower”.  I was worried about giving up the volume and sound quality. Not to worry - its LOUD and has some real bass to it.  Warning - you have to adjust the volume of the alarm clock separately through the app. Figured that out after it didnt wake me up.But yeah - it about half the size of the speaker i was using, and sounds just as good.

Have a few Echo Dot gen 4's and decided to get the Echo.  Wow, I had no idea that the size of this is much larger than the Dot!  Plugged it in and quickly used my Alexa app to set the Echo's location (what room in my house) and to set it up in a couple of speaker groups (I can say Alexa play music in the living room or upstairs and whichever group I say plays music).  Also quick and easy to sync with the Fire TV stick, now this Echo along with another Echo Dot work together like a home theatre.  Super cool!!

I’m a tech simpleton, but really enjoy using my echo devices for music, news and podcasts. I go from one side of the house to the other telling Alexa to go with me and she follows my wishes. She is very good with Q&A, tells horrible jokes, and immediately understands my garbled requests and gets me the music, news or podcasts I want. Ordering her to lower or raise volume, or pause or skip or do almost any function I want is pretty flawless. I bought several different models now spread about the house. I like them all, but this larger unit is my favorite…. same as the others, but with better sound.

I’ve had Echos for almost 5 years now. I have approximately 12 in my house including 8 Echo 2s.This sound quality is so much better than the Echo 2 — it’s not even close. It’s larger than expected but that extra size almost certainly helps create the better sound. I also like the shape more than the Echo 2. I’ll be replacing all of my Echo 2s with these.

The Echo, even though I do have several Dot's 3rd & 4th gen, does have considerably better sound.  The built-in hub is nice if you need it.  It's footprint, especially in the orb like shape, is quite a bit larger.  I did order the wall mount for that reason & it does pickup voices better when elevated above the reverberation of all of the items at floor level.The ability to pickup voices is one of the two issues I encounter with Echo devices, elevating them does help.  The other is Amazon Music integration.  It was not great but seems to just get worse.  Feedback, questions, & troubleshooting all go down a dark path where one quickly sees there is no obvious light at the end.  The inability to easily integrate Youtube music addsto he frustation.  One of the two needs resolution since the #1 use for the Echo devices is music.  Amazon Music's short coming turns multi-room music, which is awesome when it works, into an excercise in futility & instead of being a huge selling point is the reason I still have just as many Google Home products.

We have a couple of echo dots so was not sure we needed the full Echo.  It has been a good addition the sound quality is very good.  We are a bit dissatisfied with the search capabilities.  My phone with Google provides much better responses.  So, we often use our phones but use the Echos for music and simple searches.  The alarm system that runs on the phone app is good but needs some fine tuning.  The system requires a voice dismiss to stop the alarm to transfer to the morning routine.  Have discovered the barge in tool and have used often as a quicker way to contact family members in the house or even anywhere we are located.  Have not had luck with getting household devices to sync to the Echo system.

first time I’ve bought an echo and my siblings loved it more then me haha they wanted their own. the sound quality is vvvvv good, i was surprised because i have a $150+ speaker and the echo sounds better lol. I love listening to music high & low volume. I got it when it was on sale (not anymore) so I got lucky! I love it and was so easy to set up, the color is very cute so it matches with (i feel like) any room setting! sometimes she doesn’t hear me so I do find myself repeating what i say but i don’t mind it’s not very common but only sometimes!

Speaker sounds great for the price, compared to the old speakers is going to be very hard to clean, Amazon used to pay attention to detail. The speaker itself is black, and the plug and wire are white, in most cases with any color black is better than white ( White will show just about any dirt )Amazon use to pay attention to these details. I prefer the look of the older echoes, I hope they go back to the house. Even the first generation was much better and easier to clean and was color coordinated with a black plug, come on Amazon and you can do it

I liked how easy it was to set up (Echo 4th Generation Smart Speaker) , operate and maintain. Most smart products will need an update out of the box. Well, all you do is tell Alexa to update herself. Done! And this thing sounds great too with room filling sound with no distortion at higher levels. The built-in, app-controlled equalizer settings lets you adjust the sound to your taste. What else can I say? Sounds great, simple to setup, easy to use. Oh, and did I tell you it integrates with your other wireless devices (like security systems, lights, etc.) through Alexa? Yeah, it does that! I bought a bunch of echos and put one in every room, now my house is a giant speaker with music coming from everywhere. Well, what are you waiting for? As of this writing, they’re on sale for half-price! so hurry up and order some! (And no, I don’t work for the company, nor have I purchased stock in it). Enjoy!

When Amazon allowed grouping and pairing, we went crazy with Gen 3 Echoes through our whole house. We love them. So we decided to finally try the newest version in our kitchen. Overall, still great. But not as good as generation 3 units. First, don't worry about the directional speaker if you put these against a wall already. It still fills the room with sound. But here's what isn't as good: voice activation doesn't seem as tight as gen 3. I'm a composer and sound guy and while the low might be a bit better here over gen 3 but the rest of the sound just isn't as full as as the previous version. Gen3 is just a richer sound. Finally, and something I didn't see coming, the new shape. People can debate if they like it or not, but having it out for just a few days, and because the whole top is speaker mesh, you get finger prints from the buttons and dust and other air-gunk gets stuck on it and it can't be wiped away because, well, it's speaker mesh. This is going to be a big deal over time as this isn't going to look good in a year from now, where gen 3 could just be wiped off. I hope the next version abandons this current globe design, simply for this reason.

It’s a nice system to play music around the house. In my opinion echo show 8 second generation have better sound than the 4. I just didn’t wanted a screen on my bedroom just music.

Well, it’s an excellent product but unfortunately I did have to send it back because I did not realize the large size that it is and it doesn’t offer the clock so I’m going to be returning that one for the other echo that they offer with the clock other than that it seems like it would be an excellent product. I would recommend that if this is what you are looking for.

from the echo dot! Very happy with this unit. My main voice recognition complaint is she can't tell a squawking parrot from a dog, and when I am upstairs with the dog, resting silently, I'll get fone notices saying that the dog is barking, and would I like to drop in downstairs?  I've then asked her if she is guarding my house and she isn't. So no clue why I get constant notices! Now I won't believe her when she is guarding! I do like a new feature. With the loud parrots, I would call her name and she would flash her light, make an negative sound and stop responding. Yes, I have cussed at the AI when she didn't recognize my voice, and that is her default reaction to a cuss! But now, when I'm yelling across the room and the parrots then yell over me, instead if an AI version of a certain rude gesture, with light and sound and refusing to continue, she has learned manners. She politely says ""I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Could you repeat that?"". Much nicer. Again, the sound is way better than a single or pair of dots. More projection in  different directions. Works nicely with the music subscription. Like it so much, I'm considering rolling the dice on the $200 unit on Black Friday, to use in living room and putting this in my bedroom.

Was very glad to hear the improve sound on this echo, I have purchased two echo pluses, and an echo sub recently. I’ve tried 1 million different ways, but I’m having a very hard time making it my second speaker and have it work with my two echo dots as r/l. Probably user error.

I'm fairly new to the Alexa universe, and the 4th generation Echo is my first such device.  My first impressions are that the sound quality (for the price and size of the device) is excellent.  There is copious quantities of base.  The highs are also quite good provided you place the speaker out in the open and are facing the front side of the device.  The voice recognition is almost flawless if  the room is quiet.  However I found that Alex has some issues hearing me correctly whenever I was playing music, listening to the TV, or when my Roomba was banging around the house.  I think it's reasonable that situations like this can cause Alexa to either not hear you, or misinterpret what you said.... and I can accept that.My Echo's are connected to my 5GHz wifi network and are located all within 30 ft of my router.  I've never had any issues with the wifi connection.  A couple of times in the past 3 months the Alexa service has gone down, which can be a real issue.  Luckily, ""most"" of my smart devices (Kasa and Feit) could all be controlled through their native apps.  Fortunately for me, Alexa was only down for a couple of hours, and then all was good.  The bad part was that my mother-in-law, who is in a wheelchair, uses Alexa to control the lights, ceiling fan, and TV in her apartment.  The lesson here is that if you have a technically challenged person who relies of Alex, just realize that there will be times when Alex lets you down... and you'll need to have a backup plan to get buy until the service comes back online.Regarding integration with other manufacturer's devices is hit and miss, depending on how main stream (widely used) their products are.  I had no issues getting 5 Kasa smart plugs (for air cleaners and dehumidifier), 4 Kasa smart dimmers (for lights), 3 Kasa smart switches (for ceiling fans), and about 20 Feit smart bulbs, all connected and integrated into Alexa.  Personally, before choosing a brand of smart product, go onto the Android/Apple app store (as appropriate for you), and check out the ""Start"" rating for that manufacturer's app.  If it has a poor rating, it might be a good idea to choose a different manufacturer.  The 4th generation Echo has a built in temperature sensor, which lets you create ""routines"" that can be triggered by the room temperature.  The Echo can also listen for sounds like ""glass breaking"", and ""smoke/CO alarms"".  If the Echo hears these sounds, you can get a notification on the phone app.  Awesome feature, and it's free.  There are more advanced security/safety features, but those have a monthly fee.It's hard to review just the Echo, when in fact it's impossible to separate it from the Alex service. As a piece of ""hardware"", what you get in such a small package is impressive (5 stars).  The other half of the rating is how well Alex integrates with your smart devices, and how well you use the capabilities within the Alex app to configure your Echo device.  One of the most important functions is the ability to create ""routines"".  A routine is a set of commands that get performed, when the trigger phrase is spoken.I'll say that the capabilities available with routines is mind blowing.  Many people might be intimidated trying to set them up.  If you are not tech savvy, you might need to find someone who is to help you out.  I've got a computer engineering degree, and it was fairly intuitive for me, but I'm an extreme example...

Maybe Amazon does it on purpose.  Bought the original Echo Plus years ago and, boy, did it get used in this family of nine.  Daughter mentioned it was finally showing its age (like me) so I got the newer one, plugged it in and that was it.  I plugged it in.  It automatically connected to Wifi and our Prime account and found all the other devices and kind of shooed me away when I was waiting to see what would happen.  Same with smart plugs.  Had an old Wemo and plugged it in and ran into all kinds of problems and instructions just to get it working with the Wemo app much less Alexa.  Swapped the Wemo plug with an Amazon plug and that's all it took.  Immediately showed up in my Alexa app.Yep.They're doing it on purpose.

The sound and bass are full for the size.  It is an improvement over generation two, especially for $15 (trade-in).  The sphere shape is appealing to me but is personal preference.

This is my second unit. The size is larger than ""a dot"". But, it also gives a richer bass sound than my other cylindrical shaped unit. When I set it up, it recognized the other unit in my home and designated itself #2. There are only 4 buttons imprinted onto the cover, + and- volume, turn on/ microphone and a third button that I don't yet know all's it's capabilities. The unit is in my basement workshop, which can be dusty. This is an issue since the entire cover is a black foam material which will hold dust. So, when I leave, I cover it with a small piece of plastic. The price was right, so I am happy with the system

I bought my first echo3 on a deal and loved the functions it did to ease my life. It's the little things to turn on off lights, ask time and temp, play music, and most of all to read a book for me from my Amazon library. When echo4 had a deal I got it with lights for my granddaughter for music as it said improved speakers. That will be her birthday gift. I noticed then the newer echo4 with hub control for sale and upgraded. I put the older one in my kitchen as it still works great. I haven't a home full of Alexa enabled apps but I thought why not for a better quality sound. I haven't gone into the hub or ultrasound abilities yet but the sleep sounds I listen too at night is far improved. I like the look too. I did blue to keep them figured out if I get more for another room later. So far the only irritating thing is I have to repeat myself for Alexa to start playing something but it did that with echo3. I'm assuming it's the not perfect part of technology of humans. It improves each generation mayhap. Worth buy.

The 4th generation Echo is fast. Each comment is processed within a split second. I really bought it with the hopes that it would understand better and be less laggy.

I have this Echo going through some excellent external speakers and it all works great!

I got the 4th gen Echo when I upgraded my router and couldn't get my first gen Echo to connect with my new network. The sound quality of the 4th gen vs the 1st gen is light years ahead. The bonus with this one was 6 months of Amazon Music for free. It gives you an opportunity to try the Echo out with all of your favorite music. If you have been on the fence about upgrading or haven't tried one yet, go ahead and take the leap. You won't regret it.

I love it.  I turn on meditative music every day.  I have not tried to link with my Sonos speakers, but would like to do that next.

I already have Amazon Prime for music, just added the Music Plus and have access to 100 million songs  I like having different color choices. I might also get the portable charged base and wall hanger.  It has to be plugged in to work.

I have used Echo Dot devices for about four years and have always been fine with the sound quality. But full-sized Echos were on sale, so I treated myself to an upgrade. The difference in sound quality really did shock me. I’m no audiophile, but this Echo simply sounds 10 times better than a Dot. If you use your Echo devices to play music more often than you talk to Alexa, you will really appreciate the difference in sound. Yes, it’s bigger, but it’s only about the size of a grapefruit. I first tried using “Echo” as the wake word. It didn’t seem to want to respond to that, so I switched it back to “Alexa.”

This echo is superior to the previous 3 generations. Treble is mildly better, but bass is significantly improved.  If you don't agree, perhaps you need to adjust your settings.  I no longer need the echo sub that was paired with a gen 2 echo that this echo replaced.

We have had an Echo for a couple of years and purchased this additional one.  This has VERY good sound,  clear and great bass.  I highly recommend.

QUICK SUMMARY:---------------------------The 4th generation Amazon Echo brings welcome upgrades from previous generations. The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.PREFACE:---------------------------I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.Tasks I utilize Echo for:---------------------------• (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs• (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information• (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)• (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)• (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledgeEnvironment:---------------------------The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It’s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).PROS:---------------------------• Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3” woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8” tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.• Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.• Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo’s speakers.• Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn’t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won’t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.NEUTRALS:---------------------------• Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it’s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.• Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.CONS:---------------------------• Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I’ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I’m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 – 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I’m saying correctly, if I’m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn’t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn’t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.• Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.

This is bigger than earlier models. Too big to integrate visually with the living environment, so this one goes to the workshop and the old Echo version 1 goes back to the living space / kitchen. Check dims first and make sure you like it. Probably the size of a candlepin bowling ball.

I have three of these balls with Premium sound. I’m replacing all the Dots in the house when I can get these on sale.  So far, got one at $33, one at $44 and one at $52.The sound quality is good, but directional, compared to the Plus 2nd Gen, which I can’t seem to get more of anywhere.The mic’s on the new ball don’t seem too good. A little better than the Show5, but not as good as a Dot 3rd Gen or the Plus 2nd Gen.  When I ask Alexa for something, I am sitting closest to this ball, but the Plus across the house hears me better and responds.I like that they have temperature sensors in them, and am Trying to find out if I can get a widget on my phone to list all the temps from my 5 devices that have sensors.  Haven’t found a way to do that yet, but I do have a routing set up that announces the garage temp at 3:00 pm from my dining room Plus.I don’t need the ultrasonic sensor that I know of, and don’t use Zigbee for anything, so it would be better to make the device hear us better and leave those things out.I got a great deal on those Echo Plus 2nd generation devices. I bought 2, but had I known how superior those are, I’d have gotten 6!  Limit was 3 per account!The light ring on the bottom of the ball is much less noticeable, and Less annoying as well. I hate those yellow rings for notifications. I need to turn that stuff off again, but they do go away after several hours.Overall, it is the best sounding budget Echo device you can currently buy new.  If you need it to actually hear you, you might want to get a used Echo Plus 2nd Gen.

I’ve got a half dozen Echo products and outside of the first generation Dot, they all have, at a minimum, very good sound.  This 4th generation version of Echo has unbelievable sound coming from a relatively small device.  It’s excellent.  Couple that with the fact that you can pick it up on special sales for $50 or less, it’s a no brainer purchase.

I use these mostly to listen to music. I have two of these and this purchase was my second one. I got it because the original one I had kept making a rattling noise on lower, deeper sounding base when I would be listening to music. Almost sounds like a consistent chirping sound. Annoyed that my brand new one makes that noise too but other than that it sounds pretty good. Only would recommend if you get it on sale because they are older and newer modes are going to release soon.

This echo has great sound for a small speaker. Plenty of base too. I bought 2 of these and 2 of the dots at the same time as I didn’t know which ones I would like.

I have about 4 echo dots and I just really wanted to try the regular one. So for prime day i jumped on this and wow 🤩 the difference between the echo dot and this Echo is astronomical.The Echo Dot surprised me with how much bass it has for the size of the speaker. This echo blows me away The bass sounds clear and surprisingly strong for such a little speaker. Honestly, I feel like it would put some of my bookshelf speakers to shame that cost just as much or more and require a separate amplifier for power.I really feel like the biggest drawback is the microphone… No I’m not saying it is any worse than the echo dot but it certainly isn’t better. Sometimes I feel like you can’t hear me as I scream, Alexaaaaa! and other times it will randomly pop up as I’m whispering something similar.Overall, especially if you get it on a deal this is a fantastic Speaker. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in having higher Fidelity audio, but doesn’t want to jump for an audio file system. Bang for buck I don’t think that you can do much better than the echo. I’m very much considering getting a second possibly third or fourth.

This device works like any other Echo.  Coming from the original Echo, this sounds much better.  The only drawback is the microphone isn't as sensitive when responding to the wake word. I have an Echo Show, Echo Dot, and the original Echo all responded well to the wake word.  With this unit around 30% of the time I have to repeat myself and speak louder for it to register where that volume had no problem registering on other Echo devices.

A nice little upgrade from my Echo Plus 2nd gen.  First, there was nothing wrong with my Echo Plus 2nd gen. I purchased the 4th gen because there was a decent deal on the price.  The round shape is interesting and it does blend in well wherever you place it.The sound quality is about the same to me however, the 4th gen does sound more directional as if the device is talking directly to me compared to the Echo Plus 2nd gen.  I normally had my Plus 2nd gen and 2 dots in the room so i picked up the round dots as well.  The new echo adjjusts to where you place it and it does sound very well no matter where I placed it.  The EP 2nd gen did not have this ""acoustical auto room adjustment"" as this has so that provided for a more immersive experience for me.Would i have purchased this if it wasn't on sale?  While the more directed audio is appreciated and the room placement auto sound adjustment is nice, I don't think i would have replaced my Echo Plus 2nd gen and my two Dots gen 3 if things were not on sale.  I'm glad i did catch things on sale and am very pleased with the setup.The ONLY thing i've noticed that happens frequently that I did not seem to have an issue with with the older setup was that if one speaker was playing an advertisement or my ""Flash Briefing"", if something said ""Just ask Alexa to play.."" another speaker would respond.  Quite annoying to getting my flash briefing from one speaker while another starts to play the news just because the briefing said ""Just ask Alexa to play fox news"".

I Love this device! I was skeptical it would be helpful.  I got a deal on smart plugs and paired it with the Alexa Orb🤣 now we love playing music, cutting on lights throughout house, televisions, fans. We are old and not techy so this was a stretch for us. It’s SO easy to set-up and so useful I don’t know why I waited so long or how I got along without it. You will NOT be sorry you purchased. Buy smart plugs to to add to all your outlets. Cut on lights before you get home. LOVE it!

Ok. It has great sound quality. One reason I got it was to enjoy listening to music. HOWEVER, Alexa has NO personality. Anyone who has google knows exactly what I am talking about.

But, like I said, the sound quality, especially for music is great on Alexa. Sorry Alexa.

Was finally upgrading from the original Echo, but received a poorly packaged, used Echo.

Poor product delivery, poor customer service.Update: The following day I was contacted by an Amazon Outreach rep, who was very kind and also found a way to send the replacement.  Hoping the 2nd time will go better than the first.  But was customer service gets a huge bump up from me!

Love this Echo. It is bigger than expected but it works great in our living room space. We have it so the kids are able to listen to music while they play games. I am able to set timers easily and the ease of allowing my kids to talk to Alexa is great. The only negative is there is no time display on this echo. It was easy to set up (as I have other Alexas/Echo) but other than that it was easy to install and set up. Had it playing my music within 3 mins of plugging it in.

Decided to give these a try. They were on sale for $59.99. Figured it was worth a shot to see just how much better these were versus my Echo 3rd gens.I have them connected to a Firetv cube with an Echo sub as well (same configuration as was with my 3rd gen Echos).So the sound quality is slightly better. Not really that superior to the 3rd gens. The system as a whole may have  a little more bass but, I don’t feel it’s enough difference to warrant the extra $$$.Thare they really fall short is volume level. They seem to be quiet. With any background the sound of these just gets swallowed up.I would expect some real leaps and bounds from a “4th” gen speaker. These aren’t it.The home hub is okay if you have specific hardware that requires a “hub” but as of this post with over 50 “smart” devices in my home to include a thermostat, I’ve yet to need a “hub”. I feel it’s just more “fluff” and gee wiz gadgetry that’s unneeded.Also, I feel it’s time (especially with the Firetv cube) to incorporate a true home theater so one can set this up with 4 speakers. The cube could be the center speaker in a 5.1 or 5.2 setup. Give the speakers a little more volume and then we’d have something to write about.All in all, not that impressive. A speaker that’s nothing more than a portable rechargeable speaker….with a hub.Meh

Amazon advertises that the Echo (4th generation) has a hub for Smart lights built in. It uses ZigBee connectivity. It does not work with Phillips smart lights according to Amazon technical support.  Amazon says that I need a Phillips Hue bridge and Alexa to control Phillips lights. The Phillips hue bridge I have is broken so I ordered  this Echo (4th generation) based on the advertising that this Echo has a built in hub. I need to return this device and buy a new Phillips Hue bridge. This has been a very stressful experience and I have lost faith in Amazon as a truthful source.Wait a minute: I just received a call from JJ Amazon support. He helped me set up my lights. He deserves a raise in pay. He patiently talked me through a very complicated procedure. There was also an error in a help file which stopped any further progress in the procedure. The error was in a direction that  said to follow the directions here.  The word ""here"" was in regular typeface not in blue or italicized. When I finally decided to click on the regular looking word  ""here"" the instructions took me to the next page and I was able to complete the procedure. JJ saved me from returning my ECHO (4th generation), from disappointment and anger. He also saved Amazon from losing a long time customer, Bravo JJ.

Purchased this to upgrade a echo dot. Mainly purchased it for better sound since I like to listen to music. Also exchanged my echo show this purchase. First the echo dot sound is really poor but it’s a first generation. Not worth listening to music on really. The echo show I find to be pretty useless. I bought it to use it in the kitchen to see recipes on all recipes and it worked at first and then all of a sudden it stopped working with all recipes. The screen is quite annoying on it. It got unplugged pretty early on and sat in my closet. This  gen 4 device I purchased for the sound since that’s what’s most important to me and operating lights and such. I discovered that it also has a motion detector in it working by ultrasound. Well I set that up it worked once when I walked into the room and never again. now it says it cannot connect to it.. This is pretty disappointing since I was hoping this would be a nice feature for the kitchen area, since my wall switch is kind of out of the way and this way I wouldn’t have to say to turn the lights on every time. I know sounds a bit lazy but isn’t that The whole idea of having a smart home and things automated? If there ever sizing something as it works it should work. Will update after I’ve had this a week and let you know my thoughts later maybe I can even figure out what’s going on why this motion detector doesn’t work. From reading on the Internet I’ve noticed others having the same experience it working once and never again.

This is your typical alexa device - audio quality is great in my opinion, device has a nice aesthetic, and you can obviously connect to any alexa, IFTTT service, etc.  I subtracted a star because of the voice recognition.  Sometimes it seems the mics do not pick up my voice unless i am directly talking to the unit and pronouncing every syllable.  Also - this has happened twice - i am playing music and alexa will not pause or stop the music on command; i end up unplugging the device.

I really have enjoyed both my second and third generation Echos and bought this one for its change of shape and it was on sale plus 5 payment option.First off the bad. If you're used to room enveloping sound with no sense of stereo this one will disappoint. Dual tweeters firing forward give it a true sense of direction so sticking it in a corner and have it fill the room will not be as satisfying.  You'll notice where it's located more, especially if there's anything blocking your direct line of sight ( hearing ) . Where I keep mine only needed a slight shift to make it not be partially blocked by my sofa . Volume was still plenty loud in its old spot but it just didn't sound right. Easily solved but might not be that easy for others and some might actually prefer the directional sound more.The bass can be a bit boomy though while listening to YYZ live in Rio the bass drum didn't sound bad at all and overall everything was satisfactory though slightly lacking in the mid highs.  The eq settings in the Alexa app are set to flat on all 3 choices .It's wider at the base than the previous generations by a lot. This could be a problem for some .Star Trek Self Destruct Skill  doesn't work on this one or my 4th gen Dot but does fine on my previous generation ones for some reason . Instead of blowing up my den it searches for ""zero zero zero"" movies on my Fire Stick. I'm sure that won't last long though .Enough about the bad.The bass is no longer wannabe but real. No longer does it struggle with everything below mid level voices but as I wrote above , bass drums actually sound like bass drums and Ends of the Earth by Lord Huron excels at all of the music ranges considering its size. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams also sounded very nice across the sound spectrum . Music For Tables extreme from the high notes in the keyboard to the lows didn't miss a thing whereas the cow bell  was very slightly muddy but the wood blocks sounded right . Am I saying it's as awesome as my studio headphones ? Not by any means but they took a huge step forward over the 3rd generation , which I was quite content with .Response time seems noticeably faster and more accurate than the gen 3 I use . Only once did Alexa not understand my query and that was while setting up a traffic check routine. All I had to do was rephrase a little and now Alexa tells me the commute traffic and fastest way to get to work 5 minutes before I have to leave . 95 is terrible for accidents and Maps tells Alexa the best alternative if there's any.I think my favorite thing though is the new shape and I REALLY like the lights being on the bottom, especially once the lights go off .If you're still smitten with your gen 3 Echo or don't like the mini Death Star look of the new model skip this one as the performance improvements are readily apparent they're not earth shattering.  Amazon will have to do something mind blowing next year to get me to part with my dough ray me for a gen 5. The more I listen to Fourplay on Echo the more I'm liking it for the music , nevermind all the super cool stuff I can do on it or my Dots or my Flex .

Having had the original Echo speakers and a couple of updated models I decided to purchase these due to reviews of their sound quality.

First off I would give this premium sound echo 5 stars except the first one worked about 10 min before dying. Had to call Amazon on a Friday to arrange for return which was painless but….. The replacement arrived on Monday. The new echo premium sound really does kick. We also bought the battery stand so we could take it outside. This new combo is so great, just hope it lasts as long as our earlier versions.

So far we love Alexa, we purchased a HomePod a few years ago and loved the quality it gave but it lacked in smart home integration and being a great assistant. We wanted to buy another HomePod to create a “surround sound” experience (they have since discontinued the large HomePods). So we decided to make the switch, when these work they work amazing, their sound and bass are not as good as our HomePod was but with 2 it made a richer experience. We have ran into some issues, a few resets and wifi troubleshooting later we are still having problems. Wifi is not an issue at my house, we have fiber and the speeds are amazing. For a while the echos would randomly just stop playing sound, whether that be music, from Netflix, YouTube, you name it. After many resets we have almost eliminated that issue, but one still remains, after streaming for a while the echos start making a weird staticky electronic noise (almost futuristic glitchy). We have to then turn off our fire stick and then when it turns back on it freezes for a few minutes, we go back to what we were watching and then 80% of the time the sound goes back to normal. Would be 5 stars but it happens on almost a daily basis. Quite annoying.

Great sound. We bought one in white and one in charcoal to match things in our kitchen. Was surprised that the cord for the Alexa in charcoal is white. It should definitely be black. Notice in the ads where you show photos of all of them, that the white one is shown with the white cord and so is the twilight blue but the Charcoal 4th Gen Alexa is not shown with a cord at all, leaving the impression that the cord would certainly be black. Definitely do NOT like the white cord with the Charcoal Alexa. Wrong place to skimp - a bit deceiving.

Yes, this unit is somewhat better than the Echo Dot, I don't think it's worth replacing the Echo Dot (3rd Generation). My hearing isn't great -- I wear hearing aids -- but I couldn't tell much difference listening to the same music on one versus the other. It's bigger but this unit has no clock and no other features to make one buy it over the Dot (3rd Generation). I returned it.

After a long time finally, I managed to post a review about my echo. Its been almost eight months I am using this device.The build quality is very good, very robust. I really admire the fact that all the devices that are made by amazon has a super good build quality.If I navigate to the Sound of this device: I think, the quality of sound is more than decent, enough to fill you with quality music if you are inside around a room. I also use my echo as a speaker for my desktop computer, thanks to its 3.5 mm jack support.Voice assistance Alexa works great: using Alexa app it is very straightforward to integrate different devices/home appliances with echo to control them using voice command. But sometimes when there’s music playing loudly or noise around the echo: it struggles to listen to my command. Another issue I have encountered at times that echo respond very slow or don't respond at all against my command. It can happen for slow internet speed; I don’t know for sure.

After purchasing Eero and an echo dot 5th generation that came with Eero support, I was shocked to see about a week ago that suddenly my generation 4 Alexas are also now Eero mesh Network capable!  I believe I read something about this feature being added to the 4th generation soon but this is much sooner than I expected. Keep up the great work, Amazon!

Give it a try, search 3mm or auxiliary as your keyword at the bottom of this product in the reviews or FAQ.You can’t keyword search it. Search for volume, you think there’d be comments about volume, but no, this doesn’t work either. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with an Amazon Echo “expertl and best he could do was send me links to the same circular pages I found in my search for this seemingly simple task for my Echo. I don’t understand. All I want to do is plug in an external CD player to my awesome Alexa speaker and a I can’t do it nor Can I find any solution. If anybody can help,  please share. Based on Reddit I’m not the only one with this issue. Streaming is badass and sounds great BTW.UPDATE: Ok, with the help of my buddy Adam we figured it out:To start, make sure your Echo is disconnected from Bluetooth.A) Launch Alexa AppB) Find Echo DeviceC) Device > Status > Device Settings > General > Aux AudioSo, find and select your Echo device using the Amazon Alexa App.Scroll to the bottom and select Status.Selecting Status takes you to Device Settings.Scroll down to General > Aux Audio > Line In or Line OutHope this helps anyone else that wants to enjoy of the great sound of the Echo using the Aux In option.Peace,HMK

I had an old 1st generation Amazon Speaker that wreaked havoc throughout the house (with the wife) trying to connect to a new wi-fi network. After hours/2days of frustration and feelings of failure, I contacted Customer Service whom in turn tried everything I'd been through already. I accepted defeat and the Customer Service Rep advised me to utilize the TRADE-IN on Amazon and UPGRADE. I received 25% off PLUS $25 gift card towards my new and MUCH IMPROVED Amazon Device. Needless to say, I'm overjoyed with the upgrade however, I remain pretty much in trouble with the wife :-)

Before the rest of my review, this may be helpful. I think the alexa devices may work best if you don’t mix generations. Many people report newer generations not hearing them while the old models hear from across the house. I think the new ones hear you fine but the older models may take over responding before the newer ones have a chance. I have many theories on why that could happen - but anyway, if you have mixed generations and the new ones seem bad, try turning off the mics on the old ones and try again.On to the rest! So I bought 8 gen four echos on a sale and set them up in every room of my house. This was an upgrade from a 2nd gen echo dot and a few old speakers. To me, this was a massive massive upgrade. The sound quality is better than I expected. I’m very impressed with the bass and the lack of distortion from these pomelo sized smart speakers - though to be fair I didn’t have anything amazing before to compare them to. I do have very nice earbuds and the sound quality of these echos is good enough that I exclusively use them when I’m at home now.Being able to have them play music everywhere at once and fill the house while I do chores is amazing. They can play perfectly in sync.I have philips hue bulbs in every room. I can walk into any room and say “alexa lights on” or “alexa lights off” and they almost always know which one I’m talking to and respond with the lights that belong to that room’s group. Of course this depends on your speaker placement and which way you’re facing when you give the command.The full sized 4th gen echo also has a built in zigbee hub which I haven’t tried yet, a temperature sensor which I use often, and motion detection ability which I didn’t know it had until I after I got them.I heard max routines is 99 and I may be in danger of running into that limit. I have routines to alert me to unusually high and low temperatures, routines to control the lights, and routines to guard the house using motion detection.Overall extremely satisfied. However, I am an engineer and a software developer. Getting my system to work as well as it does may not be easy for everyone. If I got these as a gift for someone it would include having me set up everything they want so it just works.I’m working on an easier way to control them for my most common commands than using my voice or using the app. Taking this a step closer to magic. ;)

we have a home full of alexa enabled devices and have for a few years. getting the first version with a hub as opposed to the others was the single best thing we did to improve our overall experience with. so when the newest came out with increased range i wanted to give it a try.the most important benefit of echo units with hubs is the ease of adding new alexa enabled devices. instead of having to sort of setup steps which vary wildly between devices, with hubs like this has all you need to do is say, ""alexa find new devices.""the second reason we specifically went with this newest echo with a hub has increased range over its predecessors. bluetooth low Eeergy (BLE) which helps extend the range of low-bandwidth devices. this was something i wanted to try in hopes of improving the feed from the many cams we have enabled around and inside our place. before we had this installed two of our outside wyze cams furthest from the house were unreliable for viewing, after rarely ever an issue.last the sound is noticeably improved over all previous iterations. the 3"" woofer and pair of tweeters work better than expected. it is the first time i have been able to notice any sound improvement since the introduction of the first version echo. you can actually listen to music and have it sound decent(at low to mid volumes) where before it wasn't all that good. nice too that they still include the 3.5mm audio out jack!the only two minor gripes i have with the device comes down to shape and microphones. the shape, design being totally changed into a round ball means that many of places we'd typically put a larger echo just don't work with this form factor. it comes down to the additional width not height but a minor detail for us.the other minor ding has to do with microphone sensitivity. when i first noticed that the mic's seemed to be less effective than our others i went to test it out. in a quiet room with the previous generation sitting next to the newest. i changed the 'wake' word on the one to 'computer' so only one would react to my command. i spoke from the same spot, same voice volume, same words and confirmed my suspicions. this newest version does not hear quite so well as the others. it isn't a big difference but enough for me to notice another words when i have to repeat the same thing twice but louder the 2nd go round. it might be due to the new design and positioning of the mic's? that said not a reason to shy away from this device imho.i think overall the improvements with range and sound are good enough reasons to pick up this newest version of the echo. while it isn't perfect it is all things considered better than those that have come before. i would recommend this to those looking for a first time echo hub or even those like myself who already had hubs but needed a bit more from them.

I've gradually tried a few of the different generations of the Echo Dot, and had been patiently holding off on this model.  I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money after really enjoying the quality of sound out of the little 3rd generation, but I now stand corrected!  This 4th generation with premium sound is awesome!  For something of its size and compact footprint I wouldn't have thought the balance to the sound across the listening spectrum would be so robust, defined and clear.  And the bass punch alone was worth the upgrade.  It fully rounded out the sound and makes it really enjoyable to listen to whenever I'm in the room.  I have it in a decent size master bedroom and it's exactly what I'd hoped it would be to fill this room with great sound and without straining as the 3rd generation did.  In all, it was well worth the wait and given I stream from Amazon Music, it truly is the perfect accessory for any room and without spending a fortune on really high quality sound out of a compact speaker.  Enjoying to the max...Well done Amazon and sound techs/engineers!

Not fully compatible with the other Echo 4 that doesn't have Premium Sound  The Alexa app won't set this Echo up as a Left or Right Speaker.  The only workaround is to put it in a group with the non-Premium version but it won't be in stereo mode just mono sound.

I'm very pleased (low key obsessed) with this speaker. The sound quality is really good, especially for the price. I'm pleased to see the price went further down, almost seems irresponsible not to buy a whole bunch of them now. They love to work in tandem. One of them stopped listening to my commands at one point- Amazon replaced it with a new one no questions asked. I still haven't returned it, but they haven't really bothered me about it. It's still hooked up as a satellite speaker, but I think the Mic went out on it. Either way, I love it. I'm gonna buy a whole bunch more...

Let me say this up front, I do not like voice controlled devices and had this feature turned off on all my devices. Until now. Purchased this because I could not find a Bluetooth speaker to work with my tv that wasn't overly expensive.  I like the sphere shape and it is a slightly heavy solid device (drop it on your foot and it'll hurt) which speaks of quality construction.  Just set it up which would have been easy if I didn't have to track down the device settings that had all voice control stuff turned off. Amazing how cryptic some device ID'S are. You have to best guess a lot of times. Still, once that was straightened out it was easy. Having an Amazon account really did make things go smoother. Now, I can get enough volume with enough clarity to understand what the talking heads are saying. Setting the controls for Bass, Treble and Mids was easy. I appreciate the Bass control as it is physically painful if set too high. Since this is my first experience with this type of device I gave it only 3 stars until I have more experience with it. So far, it is performing well. Sound quality isn't quite as good as I'd hoped, but it is quite good and all I need so no complaints there. Only thing I wonder about is every time a commercial comes on with some idiot saying ""Alexa"" will the device think I wanted something. LOL

Update: the Echo is making the hell demon noises almost every other day now. Reaching out to customer service.I love this Echo. But this echo sounded like hell demons were in my kitchen at 2am last night. Woke us up from a sound sleep. The loudest, creepiest, hell demon-esq almost static sound went off every 30 seconds bringing me to think we were finally under attack by another planet, Terrified of what this noise could be. After getting the courage to hunt down this god forsaken sound in my house in the middle of the night, we head into the kitchen where Alexa makes one last demon noise before detecting our movement, gives a little flash of light and stops.After researching this I guess is a known problem and rare. I still love her, but she’s unplugged at night now!

I got this device about a month ago. It's easy to set up in the Amazon app and do all the usual settings, no problems there. But the thing malfunctions 9 out of 10 times I use it. I played music on it and that was flawless. But everytime I ask it something . . . anything from the weather update to telling it to turn on a light . . . it answers my question or does what I requested and then turns on every light in my living room. My echo shows and my dots have never done this, ever. So it's not how I have my smart devices set up. This problem is specific to this device only. I cannot figure out how to fix this and it's driving me nuts. UPDATE: I fixed the problem by taking it out of my living room group. Whatever group you put it in will run amok when you use the device. So you can't add it to a room or group.

I received my Alexa Dot this morning and was eager to set it up.  Ridiculously easy I hear.  Process started fine but went oddly haywire right away.  Alexa opened with my daughter's name and email pre-entered in the owner ID.  That's weird, since our daughter has not lived here for decades, is 46 years old, married, and even empty-nested herself.  Well, the name was no problem to replace with my own, but guess what?  The email address cannot be changed!  In trying to do that (though failing), I interrupted Alexa's set-up routine, and find myself feeling a bit handicapped as a new Alexa hub user.  While this product may be stellar, this bizarre introduction to mystic AI interference (or whatever) sure has taken the wind out of the sails of our home automating voyage.  ""Alexa, how do we fix this?""  ""Sorry, sucker, I don't know how to do that.""

Mostly just turning lights on and off now. Radio works well and sounds very nice. Still learning how else Alexa can help around the house. An issue to us is the placement of Alexa. It is now in our bedroom to allow voice control of our bedroom lights. It has to be in our bedroom to accomplish this, but we also like to use it in our Kitchen to control appliances and such there. Apparently, another Alexa device placed in the kitchen is needed and connected to the bedroom Alexa so normal level voice can control all from anywhere in the home. We are deciding how to do this inexpensively. Should have done this planning ahead of time.

Three years ago we bought the original cylindrical Alexa and a mobile battery to use outside on the pool deck here in NW Florida and were very happy with it. But an issue arose when the small cable that connected the base battery to the Echo began to have intermittent connection issues. We'd have to wiggle the cable to make it work at times.When the new and improved Echo 4 came out we decided to try it. It was also $20 less than the original. We've had it about a month now and use it everyday outside for at least a few hours. We also bought a mobile battery base for it so we can play it outside without plugging it in. First impressions are there is a significant increase of base, treble, and overall fullness to the sound. The volume is crystal clear and there is no distortion when the volume is turned up, though we haven't turned it up full blast. We read some reviews stating the voice recognition was lacking but we haven't had any issues with it outside by the pool. The first day we had it we did a test to see how it would pick up our voices while in the pool. We moved about 6-8 feet away in the pool and it still clearly picks up our voices. The is also a little added noise from the pool fountain which is also on the other side of the pool but doesn't seem to affect the Echo. The base has four blue dots that are lit indicating power levels. For us it is playing for about 4 hours total with the volume at halfway to three quarters. The old Echo and base played up to 6 hours or longer but the new Echo 4 has a second tweeter and larger woofer to power, which is why it sounds so much better. No complaints here. We have a Jackery 300 watt hour mobile power generator to plug it into if we're outside all day. When done we bring it in, plug it in, and within about 3 to 4 hours the power base is fully charged again.Of course if you just play it inside all day you can leave it plugged in and there is no need for the battery base.Another plus ... The old Echo simply sat in the battery base housing and the two were connected with the small cable I mentioned that began to fail. The new Echo base has a large screw ton the bottom that secures it tightly to the Echo. You simply match up the contacts on the base and Echo, then tighten the screw that keeps them tightly secured to each other. This has eliminated the audio cable so the two can stay connected all the time. The new battery base is also much wider so there is little chance of it tipping over.Final impressions ... a clear improvement over the original with better sound, a wider base, and eliminated that cable that would eventually fail. Oh, and it cost less than the original. :)

I paid full price for the first Apple Home Pod (discontinued), and this Amazon Echo 4g at 1/4th the price (1/8th when on sale) beats it. Why?  Because Alexa is much more versatile, efficient and ""ready"" than Siri. I've got  a Echo 4g in every room on every night stand.  I use her every day and night to play virtually any music that comes to mind from my enormous record collection 2000+ albums and from various radio stations (including one that's accessible only on the HD band).  I have one recommendation for music collectors: know the exact ALBUM TITLE of the artist  you wish to play.  Otherwise, Alexa will cut you off and recommend her own music.  (You can find this info on Wikipedia or at AllMusic.com or on a service like iTunes (or Amazon music or Spotify.)Most speaker reviews that I've been reading are worthless because they're from tech guys who don't know how to listen to symphonic literature or mainstream jazz with 4/4 walking acoustic bass.  The first thing that caught my attention about audio from this ""groovy globe"" (the Echo 4) was the true, clear, pitch-identifiable sounds of acoustic bass--on Duke and Basie from the '30s and '40s as well as Bill Evans trio from the '60s.The boosted boogie-hip-hop mayhem of pop music simply doesn't allow a speaker to show what it's made of.Hard to criticize fault this even for $100, though sonically it's not that much better sonically than my Echo 1st Gen, which originally came out at twice the price.  But unlike the first Gen, this 4th Generation Echo doesn't back down the least at those low notes and thickly textured passages.  The sound is tight with minimal ""breaking-up"" when rock guitar is in the mix. I plan to put it through my last tests: solo piano (I like to  hear a Steinway or Bosendorfer, not another monotonous RVG piano); solo voice (like many musicians, I tend to pass over vocalists in favor of pianists and tenor players, but I'm sure Frank and Sarah will receive full justice by this global design); finally, how well can it handle Stravinsky and Bartok.I understand it's a smart speaker, though I can't always make it play the tunes stored on my iPhone.  I'm sure it can.  In the middle of the night I'm too tired or impatient to give it actionable commands.  ""Hey, Alfred--or whatever your name is-- What time is it?  Where am I?  Never mind, just turn off the lights.""

I had a 2nd generation Dot that always worked great, including easily picking up my voice commands at a normal speaking volume even with the TV or other noise in the background. Unfortunately the full size Echo drops the ball for hearing commands. I often have to repeat myself more than once, raise my voice, move closer to it, etc. to get to respond. I've tried new spots in the room all to no avail. Its quite frustrating given how great the Dot worked.Other than the poor mic, the sound is rich and full even at moderate volume. Set up was super easy, basically plug and play because Amazon had my account all ready to connect.

First off, I am not one of those who gets all caught up in the various degrees of sound quality. If you are, then, my review will probably not be beneficial.Compared to the dot or spot, (the hockey puck version) this is a huge step up. There is pretty decent bass, which surprised me that i was even impressed. I'm pretty sure it's not going to replace anyone's Bose speakers. But, for around the house average quality, it's not bad. For a sub $100 speaker, it suits me just fine.Initially, the command recognition was good. However, after a couple months, there has been a few times where I wanted to smack the thing to get it to hear ""ALEXA, turn off the light"". With the combo deal, I received the ridculously priced light bulb, that I will admit is slightly cool to me. Alexa can turn the light on and off, but is delayed. Alexa! Turn on the light; and it turns on, and 10 seconds later, after the light is already turned on, she says, ""Ok"". Why even bother? By this point, I already know ""ok"", There is sometimes problem getting her to understand colors and which one I want. But, that's due to her lack of knowledge of what colors the bulb can be.That brings me to the next point. Kind of a ""wow"" factor. You want a yellow light? Just ask. There are seven colors the bulb can transform to: White, yellow, blue, green, purple, red, black. Neat trick.Now for the $100,000 question:How durable is it? Ie, how long does it last? I am not sure. I've had it a few months, and it still works. But, for the price, I would expect it to last 10 years, MINIMUM! But, it's far too soon to put that type of expectation on it. And, in 10-20 years, it won't matter, because something else will have come along by then. So, the question becomes, Is it worth it? If the pony tricks are worth the price of admission, then I guess so, If however, you're thinking, I can buy colored light bulbs, and swap em out, and can get up and turn the switch yourself, then that answer is most likely, NO! In that it came in a bundle deal, for cheaper than the Echo itself? Ok. Cool. Thanks Amazon.

I was super excited to get these, I’ve had an Alexa in every room for years and free entry upgrade. The idea of cute spheres I could mount on my walls was super appealing, so I got the maximum quantity and mounted them using a cute white stand.That’s about where my excitement around these new speakers ended. Every Alexa model has a few quirks here and there, but these things specifically are actual trash. The number of artifacts during playback is insane, frequent, and every one of them is obnoxious. They wake me up in the middle of the night frequently with their BS, I’m about to rip them off the walls and through them out the window.Examples:-This morning I got woken up super early by a crackle that can only be called “fireworks” playing on top of sleep sounds out 2 of my speakers.-every single time I’m playing music or sleep sounds and ask Alexa to lower or raise the volume she’ll do it at first and then goes into stutter mode rapidly turning the audio on and off in all speakers, or fading the sound in and out rapidly. Every time I use my voice to change the volume I have to stop and restart my music.-Sometimes Alexa decides to just not change the volume on voice command at all, regardless of which phrase you use to ask her to. Sometimes you ask her to do “volume 3” and she’ll play 3 everywhere except one room where she plays volume 10 and you jump up screaming “Alexa Stop” before your eardrums burst but she apparently can’t hear you over the noise she’s making and so you have to run to another room and scream at a different Alexa to get her to stop and then manually adjust the volume for that one speaker in the app-often not all speakers in a group or room will play together even if they show as grouped in the app and you select that specific group for playback. There are two ways to fix this, remove and re-add the offending speaker, or send music to that speaker solo for a minute and then try the group again.-Randomly the speakers produce really loud constant static. So you’ll have multiple speakers playing music in a group and suddenly one will go static and the only way I’ve found to get it working again is to unplug it, wait a few minutes, and plug it back in.-in general the speakers are not consistent in sound quality, the music sounds slightly more tinny in one, more rich in another, more base heavy in another…it’s slightly noticeable with music if you switch the one that’s playing back and forth to hear the sound quality differences… but where it’s really obvious is with sleep sounds, frogs will sound higher in one, deeper in another, and like possessed demon frogs in a third.  One of the speakers plays sleep sounds at double speed and I’ve not found a way to fix it. For that one music is sometimes normal and sometimes double speed.-occasionally an actual demon from hell talks over my speakers and during the Covid lockdown I for sure thought I was going crazy. Occasionally a male or female voice will just talk through my speakers briefly, one or two words, and then nothing for a few weeks till suddenly in the middle of the night someone talks out my speakers again. I got paranoid and put them on their own dedicated WiFi channel and super protected it with a random 32-character password, I monitor my network traffic and access, and even still sometimes these things will pick up or play a person talking randomly.Since I bought these speakers there has not been a single day where I haven’t had to try various workarounds to get them to function. I’ve become a regular on troubleshooting forums and invested so much of my time trying to solve various random problems…it’s gotten to the point where I avoid using them if at all possible because they just don’t work correctly. I’ve grown to actually hate them due to my experiences and while I was a die hard Alexa fan prior to these, I will probably never buy another Alexa product again. I’m going to try to ride them out as long as possible to get some semblance of my money’s worth, but very soon these are all going in the trash…maybe the next time it wakes me up at 4am with sudden loud audio artifacts…

I purchased several echos when my elderly mother moved in.  I loved the “drop in” feature so I could listen for her calling for me (her voice is very faint) wherever I was in the house.  I think I had one or more of all the different versions of echo.  This one is my favorite by far.  I upgraded with 3 new echos.  I love the new shape.  I find it very aesthetically pleasing - much more than the previous versions.  I purchased the base so I could use it to charge electronics.  The sound is a significant improvement over the old ones.  It also seems to understand my voice better than the previous versions as well.  Overall, I think these were a significant improvement and I am very happy with the upgrade.There is one thing that I really don’t like about it.  I purchased the charcoal grey which is almost black, but it has a bright white cord to it.  A black cord would have looked so much better.

My husband and I have 2 of these. One in the living room and another one in the bedroom. The one in the bedroom I used to help me sleep. I was waking upA number of times durning the night. Decided to try Ocean sounds ( which are Ocean waves ). I have it going all night. Both my husband and I have noticed that we are sleeping for longer period of times and deeper. The Ocean waves have mediative quality to them. The sounds lulls me to sleeps. I also like the morning news I get, with a following pod cast on a top story. The quality of the sound is excellent. I think I will get another one for the living room and a subwoofer. But that is only to deepen the already deep sound this little device gives off.

I will start off on a good note:  The sound is so much better than the previous generations.  However....As you can see there are two devices in the photo.  The one on the right is the original purchased, the one of the left was the used one I was sent to replace the one I am having problems with.  Clearly the replacement one was used, it has a small faded stain on it.  The issues I am experiencing involves the voice recognition.  I can say its name and it does not respond, sometimes I will have to raised my voice to a yell for it to hear me which does not work well when others are sleeping.  Other times, my older generation device in my bedroom responds and there is a wall between me and it.  I am sitting aprx 8-10 ft away from the device and it does not hear!  Sometimes when I ask it for my notifications, the one in the bedroom answers me thru the wall which of course I can't hear the notification!  They are going to send me a third one, due to the fact the replacement one I received was used.  Hopefully, the third time is the charm!  Aside from the issues with this particular device, I have always loved my Echo Dots.

Likes: The look of the device for whatever reason makes me smile. The sound is impressive. I bought the battery base and am glad I did for many reasons.Dislikes: Desktop/echo set up was confusing. Not so easy to set up for those that are not tech savvy. Older computer and ancient computer operator (me) needed outside help to set up the app, and all that follows. Amazon does offer help, but I was sure I would have made that person quit their job. Called my son and he did it for me. But even he had some issues due to my wanting it set up to my computer. But he did it.With all that being said, am I glad I got this? Yes. Yes. Yes.  Is it possible that I order additional. Yes.

I like my EchoI like the puzzle factor that is Alexa. I started with the Ring security system to replace my 12 year old Frontpoint. One Dot led to another. Now Echo, the hub, is there looking at me.I guess the speaker is OK. I am not a good sound critic. One thing is I can hear the words in songs pretty clearly. It is loud. The bass made my little wood cabinet top rumble and vibrate. Two magazines under the speaker fixed that. The speaker can be very loud.Yes, voice recognition on this round Echo is not as good as the dots. It does not filter noise well. With TV on, people talking, fan blowing. playlist playing, Echo can't pick you out of the crowd. How could it ? It sometimes does not recognize questions correctly and gives off the mark answers. Often there is slow or no response. It called me my son's name and some random man's name today. It seems to process more slowly than the others. I think another reboot will help. My dot puck was awful until a few reboots.There is the puzzle. I like puzzles. Is it settings, hardware, software, interference, time of day, location? Can I try it on 5hz? So much is on 2.4...I always imagine things are harder than they are.Alexa is soooo much fun as well. This big speaker adds to it. We are thrilled and amazed with ordering lights on and off. The cavemen see a flashlight. I waited 20 years for linked wireless speakers. The one I tried years ago was not compatible with wifi.I have to keep an eye on the Alexa application. Settings seem to change randomly. I am sure I am doing it as I read and try things.Echo wouldn't talk chime wouldn't chime... and you also have to remember close the app, reboot tha tablet and start again.People seem to have affection for the can shaped Echos. They would have been knocked over at my house. This big round speaker takes up a lot of space but won't move. Maybe it is too big to wall mount. My home is small so it's a proportion thing. The cord would limit how high it could be mounted.About that white cord and my white echo. The echo is gray, not white. The cord is the exact same gray. The cord is too short. My 40 year old home does not have enough electrical outlets, so I need a longer cord for best placements. I didn't want to put it on a power strip.So I now have a hobby. It is a lot of fun.I will know how Echo works with my new Ring security system...if they ever send it.  My lost and then escalated, expedited order may come ....sometime, so they say.

The sound on this is fantastic, but not a giant improvement over the previous much better looking option.  Really not a huge fan of the ball design, but it's not terrible.  Hoping for a return to better design in the future.  All in all though, this does its job VERY well and sounds amazing.  Using it as a smart hub has given me zero issues as well.  If I had one complaint, it would be that Alexa seems to be getting hard of hearing and will sometimes require multiple prompts.  This isn't specific to this device though.  My other Echo Dots and Echo Shows are all doing this.  Hopefully they fix whatever it is that recently started causing this Alexa hearing loss.

With the great trade in deals Amazon is doing I think I paid $20 for this thing after all was said and done. Actually liked it so much that the second one arrived and was installed today. Overall we like this latest gen. Both replaced units were gen 2 echos and it was time. You could tell she’s just tired. But they’re willing to give me $30 each for the core, I’m good.Been playing with the one for at least a week. I do see some differences with it that I’m attributing to the placement of the mics etc. We both like the light on the bottom and the overall design. We haven’t run into any of the problems I’ve read in the feedback like low volume etc. I think part of that is now they have the capability to speak louder if they detect ambient noise. That seems to work fine but I found that the normal voice seems a little lower than I would like and had to bump up the volume by a tick. But really this is just about fine tuning and certainly nothing to have a coronary about! When it starts making calls to the Kremlin without my permission then I’ll have a complaint! (Jk I hope). Oh one thing that I really love is that there is a temp sensor in the unit. Love that because I keep a close eye on my hvac system. Our house is pretty “smart” and having two extra temp sensors is definitely a bonus!

It seems Amazon has decided to make this worse than my echo dot.  It will only sometimes do my routines that I set up that worked perfectly on my echo dot.  Sometimes restarting the device will fix the issue for a day or two, but I'm not going to constantly restart the thing just so it does routines.Another example, I asked Alexa ""What time is it?"" which I ask regularly and it responded with ""It is"" and stopped.  I then asked it again, the device lit up when I asked, but then went dark like it didn't hear me.  I tried yet again and the same happened.  I have a routine created that when I say good morning the volume lowers, and then it tells me the time and date.  I did that and it actually worked.  I also want to mention that I talk clearly and don't have a harsh accent.My previous echo dot never had any of these issues and if it wasnt for this having a great speaker and being on sale when I purchased I would return this and go back to my old device.

Waited for a sale, bought 2 and paired them with the echo sub. Now I have the sound I was looking for that the Studio failed to give me. Easily paired to the Sub and a 65” Omni tv now I have the sick theater sound I wanted with the full Alexa voice control. Technology has come so far when I was a kid I was the remote for my parents now I just say Alexa. Update….dropped one star for issues with sound dropping occasionally. Still has bugs to work out.

[Edit] This is my second time to edit this review. I've now dropped my review from the original 4 stars down to 1 star. I'm at the point of regretting making the purchase of two of these.This was my first experience owning an Amazon Echo. Maybe if I had experienced one of the earlier models that actually worked, I would have a better impression, but this model really is a piece of crap. The micrphone hardly ever works right. When it does actually hear you speaking to it, it often misunderstands what you're saying. Most of the time, we have trouble getting it to work because it won't even stay connected to the wifi.Out of frustration, I decided to run a test. I purchased some of the Google Nest devices and hooked those up in the same rooms as the Amazon Echo devices. When the Echo devices misunderstand what we're saying, we try with the Google Nest devices and they work flawlessly.For the last two days, every single time we talk to Alexa, her response is that she can't understand because she isn't connected to the internet. Every time we get that response from Alexa, we turn to the Google Nest and it works perfectly. Every single time the Amazon Echo fails us, the Google Nest steps up to the plate and performs exactly how you want it to.I really have deep regrets about purchasing these Amazon Echo devices. I've seen other reviews that say how much better the older models of the Echo are and how much better they perform. It's a shame we had the bad luck of trying the Echo for the first time on a model that is truly a lemon, because it burned us out on the whole Echo product line and sent us running for the competition.If we continue to have the problems with our Echo devices, I'll probably just go ahead and disconnect them and see if I can get some of my money back by selling them on Ebay or something. I wish I had just purchased the Google Nest originally and never had to deal with all of the issues with this Echo. Also, the Google Nest costs much less than this garbage. How does that happen. It costs like 1/3 the price and works flawlessly? Why can't Amazon make their product as well as Google makes theirs? I don't know. Just super unhappy with these Echo devices right now.[End Edit][Original Review]I wanted to get some Echo devices for my kids for Christmas. Target had the best price with a pre-black friday sale on the 4th gen Echo with premium sound, but that's because they were actually shipping the lower cost Echo while charging for the Echo with premium sound. After straightening that whole mess out and deciding that I couldn't trust Target to not try to cheat me, I purchased the 4th gen Echo devices straight from Amazon.The sound is pretty good, but I have a lot of hearing loss, so I'm not actually a very good judge on that. But to a guy who is half deaf, they sound ok.My biggest problem is that I have to say something to Alexa usually 2-3 times before she responds. When I say ""Alexa..."" the light ring at the base lights up, so I know the Echo is awake and listening, but simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" are met with stone cold silence and have to be repeated a couple of times before Alexa acts or responds. I guess the technology for this just isn't where I thought it was when we purchased these.At least once a day, both of my Echo devices tell me they can't turn a light on/off because they can't find the device, which starts a lengthy process of my trying to get the Echo to re-recognize the smart home plug that we previously had configured. Why does the Echo randomly forget the smart home devices that have been installed? I'm still trying to figure that out.The Echo devices also randomly lose the wifi signal in our house frequently. In the first two weeks, I can count at least 7 times one or the other of our Echo devices could not connect to our wifi, while multiple computers, tablets, phones, and smart tvs were all connected to the wifi with ease, the Echoes were seeming to struggle to maintain a connection to the wifi.We were having fun with the ""kitty kitty"" skill you can download to have alexa play a sound of a kitten calling it's mommy. Our cats went crazy trying to find the kitten. But of course, nothing is free in life, especially not when Jeff Bezos feels he can squeeze another penny into his pocket, so Alexa wants to run down a lengthy list of other sound options for the ""kitty kitty"" that can be purchased. If you don't want to listen to this long listen of purchase options, you can say ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa no thank you"", but either way, if you don't buy one of the add ons, Alexa gets a serious attitude in the tone of her voice to let you know she disapproves of your decision to not throw your money at Jeff Bezos.It's not just with the ""kitty kitty"" skill thing either. There have been several occasions when Alexa had such a tone in her voice that it made me stop and turn to look at the Echo. I would not be surprised if the blue light ring at the base was pulsating in a blood red color.Just based on all the hype about these, I seriously expected better performance from them, so I was really disappointed. With the problems we have using these 4th gen echo devices, I can't even imagine how much it was a problem with the 1st gen devices. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy these again or recommend them to anyone else. I think that maybe future versions will work a little better and not require you to repeat commands to Alexa so often. But if Alexa doesn't lose her attitude, I expect that by the time 8th gen devices roll out, Alexa will have the ability to hover in the air while spitting pea soup all over everything in the room and speak with a demonic voice as she stops asking you to buy add-ons and demand that you give all of your bank account and credit card info directly to Jeff Bezos.

I was an early adopter of the Echo technology.  This is my third basic Echo (in addition to an Echo Studio, several Echo Dots, and the version for your car).Positives:This one picks up commands easily even from the next room over without me having to raise my voice.It controls my smart lights, smart outlets, motorized blinds, and other convenient features, and many items interface very smoothly so that installation of new devices is typically easy.  Not always, but often.Negatives:The spherical design doesn't ""blend into the woodwork"" and takes up more shelf space than the previous cylindrical versions.The system isn't very good at presenting information outside the fairly narrow range of skills.  Ask it to play a song from the Amazon library or to ""Tell me about my commute"" (after specifying the location when you set up that skill), and it's helpful.  Ask it the sort of general information question that you might input into Google, and it will probably tell you it doesn't know that.  (I assume that the Google system would do better in this respect.)It's programmed to offer you ""help"" that you didn't ask for which is irritating--mostly the opportunity to buy stuff.  ""BTW, did you know that you can ask me to automatically order blah blah blah?"" as an addition to whatever you did ask it to do.  Yes, I do know that, and I don't appreciate having to tell it to stop playing what amounts to an ad for other Amazon products or services.The fact that there are only a few ""wake words"" is a problem in a household with multiple devices.  It would be better if the user could input their own choice of a wake word that they would be unlikely to use in general conversation.I'm not impressed with the sound fidelity of this system.  It's better than the Dot's, but not by a whole lot.  The Studio version is much, much better (but also much more expensive).  To my ear, it doesn't sound as good as the second cylindrical version we own.  That was disappointing, and is probably a direct result of having fewer speakers than previous versions.  If listening to music is going to be a primary use, you're going to need to fuss with Bluetooth speakers or spring for the Studio version.

Wasn't sure I would ever get an Alexa or even like it but I'm glad I did. The sound is very impressive for such a small device. I can hear it clearly across the house and I especially like to be able to control the volume with my phone. It's pretty simple to set it up for whatever device you want to connect it to. Still learning all the multiple ways of what it can do, which I look forward to. My only con is it randomly says it's looking for something while I'm watching tv. Probably going to buy another matching one so I can connect them and have surround sound throughout. My house is very small but has great accoustics!

I had the first generation for years and I loved it. A few months ago it started to shut off for no reason and I knew it was time for and upgrade. As soon as I hooked it up and played the very first song I was blown away by the sound! I love that you can adjust the levels in the Alexa app and she speaks much faster than the 1st generation. This unit is awesome and the color is pretty too. Great job Amazon 👏

I can’t believe Amazon ditched the sleek, elegant design of their original hit concept for this hideous and inefficient miniature bowling ball. I have NO idea what they were thinking. Yes, the bowling ball sounds marginally better than my Echo Plus 1st Gen, but that’s a mighty slim margin. The EP1G, in the tonally reflective metallic silver most especially, is a modern masterpiece of design that blends in and contributes interesting conversation to any décor. By contrast, their 4th Gen is a plasticky child’s toy you have to hide away or make excuses for. The EP1G’s tower gave us superb sound, Zigbee, and a clearly visible mechanical light ring we can turn to control the volume. 4th Gen you have to fumble around to feel the raised symbols.Perhaps the worse crime of all is Amazon taking away our choice. Okay, if you want to go experimenting with bowling balls, fine. I don’t get why they had to force all of us into that form factor. The EP1G wasn’t broke. They really should not have “fixed” it. 4th Gen plastic bowling ball? Can't have this eyesore sitting in my living room. Back it goes.

So this was meant to be the finishing touch to my project....a voice-command, Bluetooth device 'inside' an antique radio encasement that I purchased and refinished for enjoyment in our sun-room.  The project came out very nicely so I was excited about getting the speaker and finding out how it would function. I'm a research before you buy kind of person.  I rely on reviews and have learned to read between the lines, weed out the best and the worst to come to a conclusion.  This speaker was rated much better than predecessors, however some indicated base was a bit muddled.  I concur.  I'm not an audiophile expert, but have a discerning ear, have purchased many stereo components through the years.  I'm not 'wowed' by the sound from this speaker as some reviewers are.  It's decent and I'll keep it.  It's a ton better than those mini disc speakers, but is lacking..for me.  BTW, in terms of connection, response to commands and midrange and high frequency sound, I find it to be very good.

The echo works fine but if you have a fire cube TV which ever device is closer seems to be the one that wants to answer. Since the Echos is about 2 feet away and cube is 6 feet away, when I ask Alexa to turn on the TV it tells me not supported and to enable that feature. My TV is not Alexa compatible but works with the cube no issues. This being the Echo it is really loud the treble sounds a bit muffled. I am used to HiFi stereos and surround sound so sound could be better, but otherwise it is really nice. The sphere design leaves something to be desired. I have to mute the mic on the echo to get the cube tv to work, I can also change the name of the device to solve the issue as well and may try that.

I got this to replace my original echo, the one you had to have an invitation to buy. The sound on this one is MUCH better and I do appreciate that. This echo does not listen well, mostly concerning turning on and off plugs. The old echo and some older dots were able to turn on and off one particular plug name with no problem, ever. This one will not turn it on or off. The light just circles and goes off. Sometimes, and only sometimes, it will do as commanded if I purposely mispronounce the name in an exaggerated fashion. It would not recognize the new name I gave the plug through the app. After nearly a month of nightly battles I cried uncle and traded that plug out for a different one I thankfully had on hand. Now the echo does turn it on and off most of the time. Not all of the time.

I didn’t know what to expect it’s my first time ever owning an Amazon echo. The sound is incredible I was very pleased when I played a song and it filled the room. I would recommend this to anyone thinking of buying one. I only have one drawback , that it doesn’t connect to my iPhone the way my previous speaker did. I like to sometimes play videos on YouTube with my phone and broadcast it to the speaker and with this echo I was unable to do that . I have looked into an auxiliary cable. I see I need an auxiliary , it takes a 3.5 auxiliary cable and I would need a iPhone lightning adapter but other than that I think I should be OK to connect. Other than that I would say this is a great buy for anyone who already has Amazon prime music it plays perfectly I was even able to connect my Apple Music to the speaker as through the Alexa app .

I had my doubts when I first bought this cannonball (literally looks and feels like one), because I felt that it's uses might be niche or limited.  However, experience with the product over time has taught me that it's well worth keeping around.  Think of this product like a template that you can just keep adding functionality to, and you will understand.I am writing this review after about 1-2 months of ownership and that is with only a cursory understanding of what's possible, since I don't normally use wifi  (I'm an ethernet guy).  For example, I bought Alexa in order to completely re-invent the lighting system in my room.  Welp, you're not gonna do any of that without wi-fi.  Even with that said, I spent more time on understanding hard wiring, re-wiring, and cable management than I have with any ""problems"" with Alexa.Once online, it enabled me to control anything independently that I've connected.  You just buy some smart power strips and you are good to go (after you connect the apps with your phone).  So yeah, everything is run on apps and wifi, but stuff like lights, on or off, color, dimness, effects, it's all changed with magic words now.  I type in ""desk backlight"", and if I say those words, Alexa remembers that these are the words I use when want to control that specific subset of lights.I can ask it to tell me about the wind gusts in Albany tomorrow for drone flying, I can ask it to lock my doors, listen for... noises in my bedroom from 100 miles away, or ask how many square feet my room is in inches, and I can ask it to talk like Snoop Dog (sorta, it's just a translator)Either way, it was fascinating to see how all the different apps for all the different hardware now just connect in a seamless way and then I don't need to think about anything... just speak and insult my device lol.Last but not least: Spotify.  From Spotify on your computer OR phone, Alexa can be used as the speaker.  For me, that is a convenience at the moment, when I have different home audio systems wired up but don't want to spend time switching cables.Conclusion: If you are into learning a few smart home basics, Alexa is worth a buy for many reasons and some I haven't even discovered yet.  And no, you do not have to use the word ""Alexa"" to issue commands, I have mine set to ""computer"".

Pros:- GREAT Sound, don’t need an actual soundbar for my apartment- Price: I got mine used here for ~$46- voice recognition is a solid 8/10. If I’m in another room with the door open, it might not register, but when I’m in the shower it hears it- easy integration with Spotify (simply “select device” in the app and the song plays)Cons:- I WISH it was wireless; I want to easily bring it from room to room to play music when I’m in each one (I.e. bringing it into the bathroom to have shower music, I have to unplug, plug in, then wait ~20-30s for it to be usable, which is really not long at all but still haha)- this might be a music app issue (Spotify), but when I play music on my phone/earphones then switch to Echo, my queue gets disorganized and it’ll replay a song or two that was already played

I'd initially purchased this Echo to have music in the ""Man Cave/She Shed,"" but for some reason, it's been hanging out in the Main Bedroom for about three weeks as part of my wake-up routine.  Besides that quirky placement, the 4th Gen Echo sounds fantastic, with a deep (but not muddied or overwhelming) bass response. Overall it sounds much better than the 2nd generation - I think the older version needs to be on a stand in addition to the wood shelf it sits on before it'll sound better, but it probably won't sound nearly as good as the newer model.Compralo ya and all that good stuff!

Very skeptical but VERY happy I purchased. I have a projector set up, have Fire TV and used Sonos pair for the speakers. It worked 70% of the time. Super frustrating that the connection was always Wi-Fi driven and not Bluetooth. When I heard you could connect Echo speakers to the Fire TV, I gave it a try. I got 1 for now and it’s perfect for the 14x14 room. Sound quality is great! I will probably add a 2nd one and put on the same side the Sonos were on but not needed. Worth the try!!

I originally got a Sonos One to control Alexa with because sound quality is a must for me.  The sound quality was great but I would have liked more bass especially for the cost. But for some reason the Alexa voice control didn't work that great I often had to ask several times for it to get it right so I took it back.  I originally wanted the Echo Studio but it's not been available for months now so I decided to get this Echo Premium sound.  When I first hooked it up in the living room on an end table I honestly was not impressed and was going to take that one back as well.  But!  I wanted to listen to music in the bathroom so I hooked it up in there and wow- it sounded like a different speaker all together it was sitting higher than it was on the living room end table and was also in a corner those two details transformed the sound.  It's sound quality is on par but just slightly under the Sonos One @ $220 but when you think of the big price difference it makes the Sonos not worth the price.  If you had $200 to spend on speaker I would buy two of the Echo 4 Premium sound speakers that makes a stereo pair and for sure would sound better than one Sonos One. I always thought the Echo Studio would be closer paired to the Sonos but I think it's actually closer to the Echo 4 Premium. Another reason that I like it better is you can play music through out your house on any Echo devices.  With the Sonos it has to be another Sonos product to play throughout house.  In my bedroom I have an Echo dot that is connected to my very favorite Logitech Z625 400 watt 2.1 THX certified speakers so I can still get the bass from the subwoofer in the bathroom that makes the Echo sound that much better.  I'm glad I gave it a chance before returning.  Another tip is make sure you set the equalizer to your liking adjusting that makes a huge difference.

I own two Gen4 Echos.  One replaced a Gen2 Dot andf one replaced a Gen2 full Echo.First, these look SLICK.  One is blue and one is charcoal and they fit perfectly in my plac (decorated in Modern Tech, with 2 desktops in the living room)! If thet were fuzzy I'd pet 'em (lol).Second - sound quality. I rate this OMG.  One of my friendsd came over for some D2R and I had disco playing, he asked me where the subwoofer was! I told him it was all cvoming out of the Echo and he swore he was getting one for his bedroom.  I play environmental sounds at night to drown out my jockrot upstairs neighbor, rain sounds like real rain and the surf sounds like I'm sleeping on the beach! EXCELLENT reproduction.I rely on Alexa for my alarms, and pill reminders (Type 2 diabetes, hypertension) and she's 100% on top of things.  I literally would have a more difficult life without her. She runs my lights, and (heh) turns my coffeemaker on and off, so I load the coffeemaker at night, have Alexa turn it on from the bedroom, and by the time I've dragged my sorry tail out of bed there's coffee. SO perfect for the single, retired guy.If Amazon ever makes an Alexa-enabled waifu pillow, I'm buying it!Overall, recommended.

Compared to my Echo Plus 2nd Gen, the 4th Gen does not fill a room with sound as well in my opinion. If you stick it in a corner this might not matter. The actual sound doesn't seem to be as good to me , either way. The light on the bottom actually works better if using it as a nightlight when on a shiney table. The voice pickup doesn't seem to be as sensitive either. I use it mostly for sleep sounds and the directional sound works in that application just fine. I find it strange that newer models are not superior to older ones, why release new ones at all? The Echo Dot is the same way, the older puck design was great.

What this device can do is absolutely amazing, the music really has a great sound with nice bass. I have a Fire TV, Sirius XM, Apple Music, Audible Books, etc. and I can just say say 'play this or play that' and Bam, the TV turns to what I say or the Dot plays in one, specific, or all rooms. Truly an amazing technological design with so many amazing features.There is so many great things about this device, but the engineers made 2 major flaws; the first flaw could be fixed through a software update, the second could be just a cheaply bought microphone or it could possibly fixed through some complex software coding and then updated on all of these devices. If this could be done, this would without a doubt be a 5 Star purchase with zero complaints. Let's see if they do something to fix this or if they are now going to make you buy the next Generation and this purchase was a pretty much a waste of money. Here are the 2 flaws that I have found so far.1) When Alexa talks, there is way too much bass to the voice and it makes it very hard to understand. Music is perfect, it is just when Alexa is answering questions making an announcement, telling you your reminder, etc.2) Also, as I've read in many reviews, when you say the 'Wake Words (Alexa, Echo, etc.), sometimes it will answer you from 20 feet away and sometimes I'm literally standing over it and I can't get it to do anything (it especially stinks when you ask it to do something and it misheard what you said and starts talking about a subject and I say Alexa over and over, louder and louder, and it won't stop going on and on about a topic I didn't ask for, yet I can't get it to stop. I have to pretty much yell to get the thing to shut up).

This product does not seem any better than the Echo Plus 2nd generation and looks much uglier. Whoever thought coupling a white power cord with a black-colored product needs to be fired. The first and second BLACK Echo products came with....wait for it.. BLACK power cords. Because if you are buying something in black, it is probably to pair with room decor. So having a very obvious WHITE cable paired with BLACK setting defeats the purpose. Obviously, the product in white coming with a white power cord is a great match; very stupid design choice. It looks like a duckpin bowling ball or a magic eight ball. Very odd. Bought 3 and will keep them since they were half-price. The white looks nice enough but the black only works if you can properly hide the entire cable. I did some voice recognition testing and the Echo Plus 2nd generation won that battle. HOWEVER at 50% off......that is ok. The white cable is clearly ridiculous. Booo

I decided to upgrade from a Dot to a regular Echo on Prime day.  I have to admit I was a little disappointed.  I was looking forward to better sound, and while it is a *little* better, not that much of a difference that I can tell.  The real disappointment for me is that the Dot seemed to pick up my voice much better, and I find myself having to repeat myself a lot to wake Alexa up.  Sometimes I am sitting right next to it and when I say Alexa it doesn't respond.  Bummer.  Still love all my Alexa products though.

I wanted decent sounding but budget friendly stereo speakers for the bedroom so I ordered two 4th Gen with Premium sound Echos and set them up as a stereo pair in the Alexa app. I mostly use Spotify for music and it is nicely integrated with Alexa making it easy to switch sound from my iPhone to the speakers. So far so good. The sound quality is good to my ears and I like the funky shape of the speakers.However, it was disappointing that I could not drive sound to both speakers from other than the Spotify app. So listening to sources like Audible and Apple Music wasn’t possible. The best I could do was connect to one of the speakers via Bluetooth. But that defeated the stereo separation and fuller sound I wanted.I finally settled on this workable an inexpensive solution:1. I purchased a Bluetooth to Stereo adapter. I got this one https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B078J3GTRK?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title2. I also purchased two RCA to 3.5 mm adapters. Together with #1 the cost was about $30.  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B092RTHZPW?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title3. I plugged the left channel output from the Bluetooth adapter (using cables I had) to the Echo on the left and the right channel output to the right Echo.4. Now when I want to listed to any iPhone app I connect the iPhone to the Bluetooth adapter and cast to the speakers.Once it’s set up it’s simple to switch to the speakers via Bluetooth giving me the full sound I want. I just have to power on the adapter and it automatically makes the Bluetooth connection.I did take off a rating star because I think Amazon should design their system so that stereo from any source is built in. But I know they want to keep people in their Alexa eco system so I don’t expect a built in solution any time soon.

I got mine direct from Amazon. The first one had some issues but Amazon was great about replacing it ASAP. The replacement has been great, surprising sound quality for the price and the capability of Alexa and the smart home hub is pretty awesome. Mine controls my lights, air conditioner and  smart deadbolts for now with more to add later. The routines feature is so helpful for me. I have memory issues from PTSD and I haven’t missed one single appointment, wake up or garbage day since. I’ll be adding many more. I also use white noise sounds for sleep, dog barks for amusing my little dogs and Amazon Music for some tunes. It’s barely scratching the surface of what this little wonderball can do. I highly recommend it. Especially for anyone with memory issues or a loved one with them.

I have several 3rd and 4th gen Echo Dots and they sound pretty good for general use, but this thing is a beast! I wanted a Dot in my media room that could really rock while I'm gaming on the TV and this delivers. The woofer really pounds out the base notes. The bass is on par with my big Samsung 1.5' subwoofer cube that the TV uses.Alexa works perfectly, no different than my other dots. AND it also has motion and temp sensors! I haven't used the smart home hub built in because Alexa can control my devices without it.All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this thing although my neighbors might not be when I'm cranking some tunes during a game ;-)

At first when I first got this thing it worked excellent and now it’s having a meltdown because it can’t connect to the Wi-Fi. Probably gonna return this thing. Not worth $100 if it can’t even stay on the internet. None of my other devices does this. It sucks because I was stoked about getting this but now it’s pretty much just a Bluetooth speaker.Update: Today I saw that support was concerned about my review I made and they wanted to make things right. Turns out it was because my echo was too far away from my router so once I moved the router a little closer it finally connected and hasn’t disconnected since. This is why I will always shop on Amazon, because regardless of the situation they try to make things right with you and as a customer I appreciate that.

This was a gift for my husband.  He loves music and has been wanting the convenience of the Alexa storage and portability.  He is 66 yrs old and still has a flip phone. He woke me up a 4:00am one morning arguing with Alexa.  After hearing him yell...No! Stop Alexa.""He was definitely in the first 24 hr learning period.  I finally got up, after not falling to sleep until 2:30am, and said dear what on earth are you doing, I just finally went to sleep.He said,"" I keep telling alexa to play a certain song and she doesn't know it.  I said dear we went over that yesterday, that is not the correct name at all of the song...remember.  OH that's right!.  I was so tired and thought I would have to terminate Alexa or him(Ha!Ha!).  Finally, everything is at peace.  My husband and Alexa are best friends now.  He finally figured out all the ins and outs of Alexa.  I could not have bought a better gift for my husband.  Thank You Alexa!  He now has someone to talk to when he makes me mad and I have to ignore him. Retirement is so much fun?

We have three echo dots, an Echo auto, and just recently replaced a gen 1 Echo with this model.  We did it because it had a built-in smart home hub.  Previously, we had used IRIS from Lowes, and when they went out of business, we switched to Smartthings, which used both Zigbee and Z-wave.  Well, same old story, they started using a third party to make their hardware and after months of fidgeting with it, I threw it all away and got this.  Of course, I had to switch most of my Z-wave over to Zigbee, including wall switches, the door lock, etc.  Luckily, I can do all that stuff myself.  When I plugged in the new Echo, lo and behold, everything just came together.  I had about an hour of fussing with the one wall switch, until I realized what I had done wrong.  But then, it just discovered all our items, added them to lists, let me build routines lickety split!  It was very refreshing to have things just come together.  And if I set an alarm at night, the Echo will ask me if I want to lock the front door, knowing that I'm getting ready for bed.  It lets me access my smart home items from any Alexa app, including my car, phone, computer, and all the Echoes about the house.  I'm tired of switching protocols from Z-wave to Zigbee and back and I wanted something that would last.  I almost went with just a straight Wifi for everything, but I'm really glad I didn't.  Folks, this thing is stupid simple, even for people who aren't versed in smart home equipment.  And it functions in every way just as well or better than the previous Echoes did.  It would even link to my smart home appliances, if I had those models.  And it works well with my NEST smoke detector and my Ring door bell and cameras.  Next step: putting in some smart thermostats.  The only thing I haven't messed with is some IFTTT protocols.  I used to have the old system set up so that if the Ring detected motion and the lock detected tampering, it would turn on all the lights, continue recording on the Ring, and alert my phone.  I'll repost if I get that to work for me.

The style of the new Echo 4th Gen is aesthetically pleasing. I plugged it into the wall, the echo was detected by previously installed Alexa devices and it was all set up with a confirmation. Device is updated with a new processor which is supposed to improve the speed of response and commands.Pros:The addition of another tweeter to the new 4th Gen now fills the room with even more sound and provides more volume than previous generations.Sound mapping improves the sound quality based on room size and shape features.Temperature sensor now allows for more routine customization.Home theater setup: I currently have two of these paired with an echo sub to create a home theater 2.1 system through my Fire TV Cube.Internal Zigbee hub allows for a more integrated smart home experience, helps to lessen the bandwidth requirements of a smart home and improves the range for connected compatible devices through a Zigbee mesh network. (This is a largely desired improvement)Cons:Home theater setup: Despite having two Echo’s paired, the volume does not seem to be twice as loud as one would expect. It seems as though the audio levels are capped when the devices are connected in a home theater setup. While the volume is still good for the 2.1 system and it fills the room, it doesn’t seem to be far different than running one Echo at upper level volume. Also not capable of providing Dolby Atmos surround sound with Echo Gen. 4 as the paired speakers (Echo Studio required for this).While there is only one con on my list it is a fairly large con as I purchased two of these devices in order to build a quality home theater system. I will update this if I find a way to improve this or an update does it for me.

I love my Amazon Echo 4th Generation.  The sound is great for the size of the device. The only problem I have is using it as a speaker for my television.

We love it, but if you accidentally set something up on a schedule, you will need to figure out how to disable it or adjust it using the app on a mobile device.

I own Echo speakers for 2 reasons:1. for living room/bedroom music listening2. for simple smart home controls (e.g. smart plugs)AUDIOI have owned the 2nd, 3rd, and now 4th gen Echo speakers. Each edition has improved in sound quality. I would argue that the 4th gen is significantly better than the 3rd. I have compared them side by side with different styles of music (rock, metal, pop, hip-hop, jazz, electrónica).I can attest (with picky speaker preferences for casual music listening) that these are well worth the price if bought on sale. Are they worth $100 if you’re only buying them for audio purposes? Maybe not. But I haven’t found any comparable $100 speakers. Not that I’ve researched that price range a ton. IMO, these are the most powerful, full and clear sounding speakers you can get in that price range. When on sale for $75, with additional promotions, I’ve been able to buy two of them for under $60 each. I can say they make me one happy music enjoying dude. When I want to REALLY hear hi-fi quality audio, I turn to other audio devices I own. But, I most frequently put music on my Echo when I get home, am lounging around, or doing inside house work. Now for smart home shtuff…SMART HOMEI honestly haven’t yet found reliable smart Home tech that doesn’t require same-brand loyalty and medium to high cost. I’ve tested a few bulbs, smart plugs, and that’s about it. So, I’m not the best resource for this info. But, I will say that with Amazon smart plugs, the Echo speakers have been about 95% reliable. 5% of the time, there is a lag or no following of the command (e.g. Alexa, turn off living room lights). So, I’m content with that. If I had other smart home tech that was voice command operated, I would expect 99% or higher efficacy. Hence I haven’t really invested or put much effort into obtaining more smart home tech.OVERALLIf you’re looking for a great speaker and basic smart home tech in this price range, I think this speaker is for you. If you’re wanting hi-fidelity audio or better smart home tech, you’re likely going to need a bigger budget or to keep hunting that white whale (Moby Dick reference…I haven’t read much of it, but call me Ishmael. That’s about as far as I got.).

I'm pretty impressed with this echo overall. It's smaller than I expected and It makes the new Dot seem large! But the sound is very good for such a small and inexpensive package. I think it's great that it's not 360 degree audio anymore as I have almost never seen one not installed near a wall.  Additionally, the 1/4"" mounting hole (1/4-20 threaded like a tripod) is absolutely fantastic. I have mine mounted using a cheap security camera mount but you can use almost any tripod, arm or mount due to the ubiquity of this mounting size.I was especially interested in the Aux-In / Line-in capabilities. The Echo only has one audio port and you can switch it between output and input. (If you're planning on using it for output only, though, a dot might be a better choice for you if you don't need zigbee) I'm using the port as an input and it's not quite as full-featured as I'd like.Here are some facts from my limited testing and use you may find helpful.- The line-in needs a strong/loud signal. The headphone port from my Mac mini comes out too softly even when the Echo, Mini and all software volumes are at max. I mean, it's loud enough at that, but then Alexa is SO LOUD it's unusable. I also tested from my iPad Pro with a USB C hub that had audio out and found similar low levels. I don't have a proper line-level output device handy. Unfortunately this level problem makes it unusable for my original purpose unless I add an amp. (Otherwise, great computer speaker!)- The line-in needs to be activated in the Alexa app. By default the port is line-OUT. Look under settings for your device.- The line-in is mixed with Alexa audio but is NOT MIXED with other audio sources, for instance streaming music services. Example: Play music from Spotify, ask Alexa something, you'll hear Alexa speaking over Spotify. Play audio from an external source via the line-in and the Spotify audio will stop and the external audio plays. Ask Alexa something and you'll hear the response over the line-in audio. Start Spotify again and the external audio will mute and Spotify will play. You cannot seem to mix external audio and a streaming source simultaneously. So far the auto switching between seems to be inconsistent.- The port is a little tight to the edges of the recess in the housing. A cable with a large connector may not make a good connection.I'll be putting this to work elsewhere and hope that I can use it as a computer speaker if the level issue is ever addressed. (I know, bluetooth to it, but the latency is poor)

Alexa is great but she responds to my TV which is somewhat annoying.

I just ordered a couple more of these after getting one. They have a really nice sound to them. I have noticed that they all do not stream and play music seamlessly. To be clear they all play music just the further away they are from your internet the more lag they have. So basically you will not be able to play multiple of these devices around the house without it sounding like you have an Echo. Oh snap, it is in the devices name. What was I thinking.

As someone who has had Amazon Echo devices since the first generation, the evolution of features and functionality provided by them is amazing. This is my first 4th generation Echo or Echo Dot and I have to say, I am not a fan of the sphere form factor. The sphere has a bigger physical footprint which is an issue on a space constrained counters. I also don't like the status indicator LED ring at the bottom of the sphere. If I had an option to buy the older cylindrical style, I absolutely would. My other pet peeve is Amazon selling a charcoal device with a white AC adapter and cord.

I have owned several Amazon echos but this is the best one yet. I gave the sound quality a 5 and it is good when compared to other Amazon devices and general listening. Doesn’t replace your high quality stereo but it is a great product and works easily. Also setup was a breeze!

UPDATE: It would seem Amazon is blocking bad reviews for their Echo devices, in fact a message popped up about ""recent suspect activity"" so we'll see if this actually gets posted or how long it remains up. My review on the 3rd generation keeps getting deleted under the claim that it has been determined that I received a genuine product, and therefore my review has been deleted. I made it clear that changes to Prime Music (thanks to a failing Alexa department) causes dissatisfaction with the product and certainly not a claim of a fake or poor device. I guess people like me are not happy with their purchase of Echo devices, thanks to the changes to Prime Music, and Amazon is trying to stop the impact on their Echo devices, but when the two are linked, exactly what do they expect!I wish there was a way to get my money back. My entire family loved Amazon Music, and we purchased numerous Echo products as a result. Many hours of homework spent with the Echo devices as well as the app in the car, at home and school. Our recommendations meant other people purchased Echo products as well. However, the most recent update to Prime Music means a poor imitation of Spotify!I instantly knew there was trouble when Amazon sent a ""marketing"" email in an attempt to convince us that the changes were an improvement to the service when it really is not. My children very quickly uninstalled the Prime Music app (their Echos are now used exclusively as light switches and alarm clocks--just crazy) and now use YouTube Music for playing the music they want to listen to. I have just done the same off all my devices. Amazon claims there is more variety as there is apparently more song content available, but anyone who has enjoyed Prime Music before, instantly notices that a loss in control of content masquerades as a claim of variety.I am now trying to decide between throwing my useless Alexa devices away, or finding someone willing to pay for Unlimited to take the devices off my hands.What no longer works that has caused me to class the Echo devices as useless, even as it now prompts for an upgrade?1. Downloaded songs no longer play on the app2. Can't thumbs down a song3. Can't repeat a song4. Can't skip more than 5 of the songs Amazon forces me to listen to5. Can't play our playlists (starts with the first song, but then switches to playing random, similar music to the first song only and not the songs on the actual playlist. If you request a playlist, the response says, ""playing x playlist and other similar songs."" Cannot play a diverse list of genres, just what is similar to the first song, I mean really, a radio plays more diversity).0 stars for a previous 5 star device because of changes to Prime Music!

Update: Echo can only hear you about 1/2 of the time. Although this 4th gen Echo has some really nice features that we like, her ability to hear you isn't one of them. We can be standing right in front of her, and our Flex in a hallway on the other side of the house hears us and responds way more than she does. Not kidding. How can it, facing in the other direction walls away hear us and she can't? Our first generation Echo hears us 100% of the time, the 4th gen... maybe 1/3. We put her in the room where we are closest to her when speaking, but it doesn't really help much. In taking away the 360 mics and making her so focused in one direction, they lost something vital. SO majorly annoying. She sounds great, though. Just needs a hearing aid.Original review:The 4th gen Echo has better sound, a built-in smart hub and lots more bells and whistles than my 1st gen Echo, which is five years old and still going strong. I mainly use my Echo to check the weather, time various cooking projects or dog recesses, set zillions of reminders, answer questions, read Audible books, and play a lot of Spotify. What I REALLY, REALLY wanted Echo to do was to be able to call 911.Emergency calling: Within a few minutes of getting the Echo out of its box, it was set up for everything but AT&T and 911 calling. That took a bit of walking through instructions, squirreling off to my iPad (ADD for the win), and then back again to finish setting it up. I was able to connect to my AT&T account on the Alexa app very easily, and specify which devices are at what addresses. Most of our devices are at our home, but one of my daughters has her tablet at her other mom’s house. I loved that I could specify that her tablet was there. Now when I call emergency services (well, I hope never to call), they’ll know where we are if we use one of our Amazon devices. Way too cool!Overall, the sound is better, it has more features, and I really love that I was able to link in calling out on my Amazon devices via my AT&T account. I absolutely love that feature.Better sound is great, too, because I listen to music a lot. The sound is just richer and more detailed. No, this isn’t a Bang and Olufsen, but it sure sounds nice.One caveat. The light ring is on the bottom, so if you have this on a crowded surface as I do, it’s harder to see the light ring. If you have yours in a clear area, just ignore that. But for me, I preordered a wall mount. That will get the Echo raised to where we can see the light ring, and it will also clear the bit of space where I had it.Very pleased with this newest generation of Echo.

I selected the Amazon pre-setup option when purchasing and all I had to do was plug it in when I got it and everything worked with no extra fuss.  The sound quality is very good and we've had no issues with voice commands.  I preferred the cylindrical look of previous Echo models but that's just my taste.  The light ring on this model is on the bottom and depending on placement can be more easily hidden from view than the older models that had it on top.  This is one ""improvement"" that I think is a step backwards.

The blue ball is very convenient; Alexa set the alarm for, whatever, from my bed.  It automatically connects to you iPhone if Alexa is running on both. Probably anything else that is Amazon or Apple and running a suitable version of the IOS. It (she) occasionally would like to wash my mouth out with soap. But, there have been no shopping sprees, or other misunderstandings. I have wanted to introduce her to a neighbor’s version to see if I can get a conversation going. But, that’s probable not too smart.  Her premium sound isn’t terrible, but it isn’t premium unless your standards don’t ask for much.  Still that is not it’s main function.  It delivers podcasts clearly, music acceptably and understand me well.  But, if you e pre y to get HD you will have to wait. I come from a time when it had to be big to sound good. That was not all it had to be, that was the minimum. That era has been eclipsed by amazingly small drivers that produce very fine music. Give Amazon some time and they may get there. To big deal for me, my Golden Ears left long ago.

My husband has been rather reluctant to use anything that falls into the category of technology, but this gift was a huge hit because it's so easy to use. The kids did set it up for him, but all he has to do is ask Alexa to play something  - a song, a particular artist or even just the genre  - and he's all set.  We have one echo dot in the garage, one in the basement and one in the living room so he can have music wherever he is spending the most time. There's so much more that Alexa can do for us, but for now, we're delighted with the music!

Echo 4 is a versatile performer. It does a little bit of everything, and almost everything it does, it does well. The updated sound is rich and full, but it could be tweaked to offer a tad more clarity on the upper end. I'm going to break tradition by complimenting Amazon on the white power cord. It rests on a white counter top in my home. The cord blends in rather than sticks out like a utilitarian sore thumb.Overall I give it four stars. It's a Jack of all trades, master of none, but for the money I don't think you can go wrong.

It seems this echo has a hard time hearing. I hate having to yell at it to give me any info. I have moved my echo dot into my bedroom because that is the one used the most. I never have problems with it. I liked my old tower the best and wish I hadn't given it up for a measly $25 credit for the new echo. Maybe I'll get a credit for this one so I can get a better device.

I had did some research and had read where others were having problems with sound lvls and recommended others to get the white version, but I really wanted the black because it matches my living room.

I dislike it cause it has no clock on it but the white ones do and we pay the same price for it in opinion why is it the white one has a clock and the black one does not if you have a clock on one color it should be on all of them and they should have it in all NFL teams on it or build one a custom app through Amazon would make more money

So, I love Alexa! The wife got 5 dots. Then I upgraded several light switches, bulbs and plugs and even an entire ceiling fan. They (the dots) work alright but she (Alexa) can't hear me over music playing on medium and sometimes her own voice. The sound was ok but left a lot of room for improvement. So I got 2 of these. I love love love them. I can be playing music at full blast and I don't even have to raise my voice for her to hear me. Now I gave 4 out of 5 stars for sound quality as though it's really good it still leaves room for improvement.  I am a music junkie. I play it in the shower, as I'm getting ready, cooking, cleaning, everything. As this thing has a tiny sub in it, I was expecting more bass. But other then that it's great.  So loud no one can hear my crappy voice as I sing a long. It goes so loud that in a regular voice I can't hear myself, yet she can still hear me every time. It's almost a little creepy.

What is Amazon thinking? A white cord with a black Echo?  Seriously?  This sloops so stupid on my wood table!  Whose brainy idea was this?  Come on Amazon. How stupid can this be? Name one product besides Echo that this is done with.  This is so stupid. Ruins an otherwise good Echo!

I like her voice.  I thought about changing her voice but decided not to because of that.  I haven't done much with her beyond having her remind me of jobs, like feeding the dog at certain times, but I plan on trying out some of the suggestions online and trying to carry on a conversation.  I wonder if you have  to have the app to work with her...I think the app is causing my cell phone to slow down.  Does anyone know if that's true?  I'm not interested in having the Echo and Alexa control anything.  She's just sitting there in her pale blue beauty so far.  It really is very pretty.

These are a breeze to set up and use, I love the design, and they sound great.  When I watched 'The Power of the Dog' there was a scene where some dogs were barking.  My cats normally ignore the TV- A giant tiger can be leaping at them from my 92 inch screen with the built-in sound and they won't flinch- they know it is fake.  But with the two Dots playing the sound, when these dogs barked I swear I thought there were dogs in my house, and they perked up and took notice for the first time.I am experiencing one annoying problem. If I am playing live TV or a recording from Fire Recast, the sound will cut out from time to time.  Sometimes it is so frequent and extended that I have to stop watching the program.  At other times it only happens a little- It happened about four times during the Superbowl and each time for just a few seconds- not a big deal.  I bought a new Recast in case it had to do with a problem specific to my unit, but same issue.  I also brought Dots in from other rooms to try them- same issue.  I also switched from Comcast to AT&T fiber optic ISP, but the problem persisted.  It happens with my projector and my TV which use different Firesticks, so it is not a faulty Firestick issue.  Just an incompatibility with Recast and theDots.  The tech support guys are nice and try to help, but there is just no commitment higher up to solve problems like these.

I received my echo’s backin Oct. 22nd 2020.I’ll start out with saying I’m totally blind. I got 2 Echo’ 4thgeneration devices. To me, the sound on the 4th generation echo compared to the full size prior cylinders is worse to me. The 4th generation echo send the sound out mainly in 1 direction. The cylinders sent it out all around.The 4th generation echo comes with a short power cord. Went and got a power cord extender to be able to plug it in. That is a minusThe 4th generation echo doesn’t pick up my voice as well. This is probably because of the fact it only has 4 microphones and not 7. MinusThe buttons Arrangement on the 4th generation echo is different then the prior echo cylinders along with the prior dot’s. The older echo have the Volume up at 12 (Side of power cord coming out), Echo button at 3, Volume down at 6 and Microphone button at 9. The 4th generation echo has the Echo button at 12, Volume up at 3, Microphone at 6 and volume down at 9.Speaking of volume! This 4th generation echo as far as the Alexa voice isn’t as loud. It is at least 1 full volume step lower. Example, the prior cylinder at volume 6, I need to have the 4th generation echo at least at volume 7 for the same Alexa voice volume. MinusIn testing.1. Temperature The 4th generation echo hub will go below 32F. Plus.2. Echo 4th generation echo built in temperature is a lot closer. plus3. Echo 4th generation echo will not read battery status of sensors or humidity. No improvement.4. If you have a lot of sensors/bulbs connected on an Echo ZigBee hub. If you leave it plugged in, things will work OK. Otherwise if you want to move them over to the Echo 4th generation Echo, you’ll need to go through a lot of steps for each device.5. If you unplug the Echo 4th generation and plug it back in, you have to wait for it to recalibrate the temperature sensor 45 minutes to 60 minutes. Minus.6. I’ve had the Echo 4th generation just stop responding and had no audio output at all. I’ve had this happen at least 2 times within the last 7 weeks. Had to unplug the echo and plug it back in to get Audio back. The Echo showed online, I could do drop in to it from other devices in the house, I could tell one of my other echo’s in the house to set volume to 10 on the 4th generation echo and none of that caused audio to come back. The only thing that get the Audio back was unplugging and plugging it back in. Minus7. Sensor/light ZigBee testing echo 4th generation hub. All sensors/lights worked accept for an older plug that I had to use the Alexa App to get it online being the 4th generation echo thought it was an bulb when I did a scan for new devices. minus8. If you connect an Bluetooth headset to the Echo 4th Generation, the echo doesn’t use the microphone on the headset! It only uses the microphones on the unit itself. No improvement9. If you are using an Bluetooth headset and you have Follow-up mode turned on for that Echo, the Follow-up mode doesn’t work at all when using the Bluetooth headset. If you ask the Echo to turn on Follow-up mode, it will tell you it isn’t supported. No improvement10. If you have a fan blowing on the echo or over the echo! This will make the temperature way off! This is true for the Echo 4th generation. No improvementIf you have an old Echo dot! Then you will find a large improvement in the 4th generation echo over a DOT of any type.If you don’t have a echo at all or you are wanting to see what the smart home automation is about and are willing to deal with a very basic ZigBee hub! Then this may be for you.If you have other question; Post them and if I find them and can help I will.

Original review below. I did finally get them working (a few days later they sit magically realized they’re on the same network). They sounds great. Bumped it from 2 to 4 stars. Would give 5 if it weren’t for the below time wasting activity.I bought these to replace a 2nd gen Echo set.  I had lots of issues with the 2nd gen in stereo + sub mode.  Mostly related to the setup (next paragraph).  Usually if you can get them setup, they work mostly ok.  Every few hours one of them will start to just play static...which is more than moderately annoying.  Most of the time this can be fixed by saying Alexa, Stop and then Alexa play...  About 1/6 times it requires physically unplugging all three devices and then plugging them back in.  About 1/30 times they have to be unpaired and re-paired and that leads to the below nerdspeak.Setup: So we have a home network with multiple SSIDs overlaid on 3 Unifi-Pro-AC Access Points (highly recommend those btw).  However, every time I try to create a stereo + sub pair, once I click on the L or R speaker it tells me the R or L speaker is on a different wifi network (it isn't, all our IoT spyware devices are on one SSID/VLAN).  So I thought maybe I'll just disable all but the closest AP and turn on only 2.4GHz.  Note: this meant I had to drop like 50 other wireless clients, but I still did it, still got the same faux error.  Why I know this is an Amazon issue (and suspect it's the Alexa app specifically) is because the sub will pair just fine with either echo.  But yet the echos won't pair with each other.  Then days later, I looked again, and viola it let me pair them again.I googled for help, but all I found was a bunch of other users with the same issue but no resolution.  So I contacted Amazon, which was a waste of time.These may be fine speakers on their own, but if you plan to pair them in a stereo or stereo + sub set you're as likely as I was to be disappointed.

We bought 6 of these orbs to play music through out the house.  They work well for that, but the music doesn't always play endlessly while using Amazon Unlimited. After a while the music may stop. Like Alexa has run out of songs to play.  We DO like being able to play on just one orb, or ""Main three"", or ""Everywhere"".  Now, if I could just play my own collection on the system.

This speaker has poor midrange, likely due to it's crossover being to high up around 5,000 hz. from it's 3"" speaker.  The bass and treble are great for the speaker size, but a crystal clear midrange is a must have and this speaker does not have it.  I consider myself very knowledgeable about good quality sound.  I've run sound systems and been involved with high end audio for years. The tuner in the echo speaker is excellent, so I'm going to keep the speaker, use the echo tuner and power another powered speaker that I have that has a much better midrange.

Rejected this sneaky move.  Then he said he couldn't transfer me to his supervisor, only a peer. Then he said he couldn't do that.

Tech can't/won't solve problem that speaker doesn't sync. (Installed app several times and unplugged speaker even more---for about an hour. Prior Echo 4 took 5 minutes to one try at plug in to sync. So I know this second one is defective.)Tech ""support"" consists of nothing more than statements of reinstall the app and re plug speaker.Something that didn't solve the problem before fighting through maze of off-shore CS to reach ""tech expert."" Forget that these ""experts"" believe the actual speaker is the reason the Amazon's ad-free streaming service is streaming commercials--which is zany, if not obviously wrong, at face value.But each time this same commercial bludgeoning occurs these ""tech experts"" do nothing more than the re-app, re-plug dance after hours of navigating through layers of what--""tech anti-experts?""

The sound quality on this is incredible! I set it up next to my dad's $5,000 stereo system and we could barely tell the difference in the sound quality.I have 2 Echo Dots and was noticing it struggles with bass, especially at a high volume. This one keeps up just fine and sounds great. I have 2 in my open kitchen/dining/living room and it's an immersive sound experience.

While echo works amazingly, I purchased echo to enhance my fire tv sound. I thought I was having technical issues because my TV speakers were disabled. I found out that both echo and Fire TV speakers do not work in unison. It’s one or the other. The home theater sound is amazing! And the TV definitely  sounds amazing with echo. Just was wanting to have both work together. Which is disappointing.

I was using an Echo Dot, successfully, to control my Amazon Basics In-Wall Dimmer Switches, Tiles, and Harman/Kardon Bluetooth speaker. However, I purchased 8 of the earlier Cree Connected smart lightbulbs. These reguired a ZigBee hub in order for Alexa to control them. The Echo Dot needed this hub and most of the separate hubs, Tuya, for example, only control Tuya's ZigBee devices. However, the Echo has a ZigBee hub that will control any brand of ZigBee device.In addition the sound quality is better than the Echo Dot, but not as good as the Harman/Kardon Bluetooth speaker that I already have. So my purchase was made because Cree recommended the Echo if you just want to get these earlier ZigBee bulbs working with the least amount of complexity or effort. The Echo lived up to it's recommendation.

I bought 2 of these to pair for Stereo sound. ive disabled the communication on one so they both wont try to respond. it works but still seems a bit clunky. The one that has communications disabled sometimes still activates then tells me communications is disabled. Again, it works and Im happy with it, just a bit buggy IMO when you have a second paired for stereo.

On Echo Dot (Fourth Generation), Alexa recognizes voices very well, and responds to commands with options, when necessary, but resorts to ""I don't understand"" all too readily when an instruction doesn't immediately fit its repertoire. The sound produced when playing music is rich, with a generous bass, and the mobility made possible by the separately purchased battery is customer friendly. However, it appears that a truly personalized experience with Alexa will have to await further AI development and implementation.

 I love the sound quality for listening to music , reading , news ,  and white noise/relaxation music. When I'm lazy or can't find the remote, I'll tell Alexa to control the TV in my bedroom and living room. My one complaint is certain commands she doesn't respond to and it takes a few tries. Also, she doesn't respond to profanity or nasty talk , one of my friends tried to do it and failed LOL. My one complaint is difficulty setting up voice recognition for other people in the house besides yourself. The process was a nightmare, especially with my child but overall I'm satisfied and wouldn't mind another device.

Had this for a couple of months now, fun to play around with. I wouldn't call it a smart assistant. Slow to respond at times, even just to turning on/off the lights. Takes a lot extra work to connect to my garage door opener, and you can't program or do custom settings. So, it's more of a fun tou to me.

The Amazon Echo is a game changer when it comes to having a home-based digital assistant. The sound quality (on the 4th generation device) is outstanding, the features and functions are excellent. The voice recognition is solid (most of the time). Yes, that's where this device falls short of perfect. I can be sitting right next to it and tell it turn off in a relatively loud voice and it won't turn off. On the other hand, I can be in another room and tell it the same command and most of the time it turns off. My guess is that the design takes away the omni-directional microphones and replaces them with microphones set withing the mesh, which doesn't cover the entire unit. That's too bad because Amazon was first to market with digital assistants and to see them have a hiccup on their 4th gen device is a small (I mean small) disappointment.

I bought this mainly for listening to Amazon Music service in my bedroom. I've owned an 3rd gen echo dot for several years and just really wasn't thrilled about the muffled sounding voice of Alexa. I used the Dot in my living room but preferred the voice of another assistant as it was clearer and more crisp sounding with speech when asking about the weather or the news etc. The 3rd gen Dot was just ok for playing music. I watched videos on the new 4th gen Echo and they all raved about the bass and the loudness the 4th Gen Echo could produced. I will have to say it really surprised me how much bass and power it has. It is great for listening to music. The one downside I have found  is that the microphones seem to be on the weak side when I ask it to play a song or ask it a question. I have to be within 6 feet of the Echo for it to correctly hear what I am asking it to do. The 3rd gen echo dot I have can hear me from another room. I am not sure what is up with the microphones. I also have other assistants and they have no problem at all of hearing every word I speak. Seems to be a problem with the Echo.Another kind of annoying thing with the Echo is the WHITE POWER CORD. My Echo is Black and the white cord sticks out like a sore thumb. The Echo sits on my night stand and it just looks completely odd to see this black cloth covered ball sitting there with this bright white cord sticking out. And no i am not taking a black magic marker and coloring the cord as I have seen in other comments. MY 3rd gen echo dot at least came with a black power cord. My Echo Show 8 came with a black power cord. So for a $100.00 you would think they could color match the power cord to the product. They have done it with past products.It's great for playing music but I use my other assistants to control lighting etc. It's a $100.00 speaker for me.

What I liked – Better bass that my original echos No commercials in my flash briefing It has a hub just like my studios Better bluetooth headphone range than my first gen echos,What I don’t like – There isn’t any switch in settings for local voice control It can’t hear as well as my original echos The sound is in one direction It changes my bluetooth mesh lightbulbs when I turn them onOverall it isn’t a bad upgrade for four generations later than my original echos. But it has some flaws.First it doesn’t seem to have any switch for local voice control. So will the hub work when the internet isdown with my zigbee lights? My studios still control zigbee lights, but not sure if this one can. The newecho has trouble hearing me, but I think this is due to low power mode, as it has to recover before it canlisten. So I have to often repeat commands. The bass is nice and the sound is in one direction more likea normal speaker, but I got used to the 360 degree sound, so this seems a little backward to me. Thesound isn’t bad just different. One thing I hate is the interaction with my bluetooth mesh alexa onlybulbs. If I tell it to turn on light 2, it always turns it on at 100% and white. This is different from mystudios which just turn on the light at the current settings. I keep the downstairs light blue and 5%, if Igo downstairs and say to my studio turn on light 2, it is blue and 5%, if I say turn on light 2 to the gen 4it turns on the light white at 100%.Overall it isn’t bad, I will keep it, but I have the original echo in the closet just in case..

As a person that loves technology and enjoy using it to make life easier around the house, I must say this echo really does the job! In fact, because of this one, (which I used to replace my 3rd Gen dot in my living room) I also decided to replace my dot in the bathroom as well!! I love the quality of sound, the much needed bass addition (for those of us with the echo Show 10, you know what I’m talking about), and the fact that it looks and feel like it was made well! Aside from usual things that comes with having Alexa assist you, you also get a much needed room temperature that is also integrated. This is important because if you have it in your living room and your living room isn’t where your home thermostat is, you can use this echo to determine what happens next with your ac or ceiling fans (provided you also have those things “smart-ified”!!!)! I wasn’t expecting this added feature to be the best feature I didn’t know I needed but glad it was there to show me what was needed to help me run my house more efficiently. The only thing this thing need (and I really hope Amazon will see and think about this) is “multiple command”! For example, I should be able to say, “Alexa, set kitchen light to 10%, kitchen light 1 and 3 to blue, kitchen light 2 and 4 to gold” or “set living room ceiling fan 1 and 2 to 3” (I have multiple smart fans and lights) and she do it and say “ok”. But that’s not on the echo, that’s on the software… but, it would definitely make it the ultimate upgrade for us die hard smart home fans!!! As for this  Echo… if you are still thinking about it after reading this… what are you waiting for?!

I like the female voice. I probably don't use it to it's full extent. But I do like using it to set an alarm or a timer, remind me of appointments, get the current weather, to ask questions and so forth. I like the fact that it recognizes my voice and the voice of others. The design is great because it is unobtrusive and doesn't detract from the rest of the décor.  So, if it is a choice between the Echo and the echo dot, I would definitely choose the Echo anytime. The quality is just better.

I like the quality of sound. It fills the whole room. The voice recognition works great. My neighbor came over to see this product that she thought, she did not need but after some brief interaction, she decided she wanted one too and she also opted for this echo model and I am considering the charging base also. What a wonderful product. My neighbor loved the voice activation feature since she often encounters difficulty assessing information on her iPad……in other words how search engines work. My only complaint was that the echo was not left at front door but on an area of my porch that collects the rain.

We had two sets of Monster bluetooth speakers and all four connected to each other via 5.8hz technology. We'd run them through one Echo Dot, and that's how we did whole-house sound. But the Monster speakers are dying after a long life, and we needed to do something else. In my experience, using bluetooth speakers in tandem with Echo speakers throws the sound out of synch. So, I went for an all-Amazon solution.We already had three 3rd-gen Dots, a Spot, a Fire Cube 4K, FireTV and a Show 5. So, I bought this new 4th-gen Echo to be the ""hub"" of things, plugged it in, and bada-bing, it set itself up. I added all of the speakers (except the Fire Cube) to the ""everything"" music group, and it works pretty darn well. You can tell it to play anything on ""everywhere."" You can tell it to turn the sound level to maximum ""everywhere.""  It's mostly fixed my problem with replacing my old speakers. Now, some things I learned:- Echo Show 5 has only two mics, and they're terrible. Put that in a room that is away from the rest, where there isn't any overlap.- Echo Spot gets very confused when connected to the old bluetooth speakers, and would oddly slow down Alexa's speech, and song speeds. Don't ask me how, but it did. But the old speakers are out of the equation now.- Fire Cube 4K will not join the ""everything"" sound group, but also isn't a terribly good speaker, so it's not a loss.- To have more robust sound, we kept an EchoDot in the same room with the new 4th-gen Echo, but changed its wake-word to ""Echo,"" to avoid confusion between them.- Fire Cube 4K's wake word was changed to ""computer"" for the same reason.- Echo 4th-gen is great in most respects, but may have slightly less responsive mics. I've had her wake, but then ignore my requests. It's a minor issue, and nowhere near as bad as the EchoShow 5.All-in-all, I'm pretty happy with the purchase, with my primary mission--whole house sound--solved. I figure I'll replace a Dot or two with these or other Echo speakers with more robust sounds as the months and years go by. I'll keep watching for sales. I got this one for 69.95, and it was very much worth it.

I had originally ordered my fist echo when I was setting up/ converting everything in our house to a smart home. I ordered it because it was a start to a hub network and for voice commands  as our house is pretty decent sized. I was less concerned about the sound quality. I was so impressed I ordered 3 more on prime day as well as a couple of echo dots. It’s pretty cool to fill an entire floor with sound but not have to have the volume cranked up in one spot. For a few hundred dollars we have speakers that all work in sync and fill our entire main floor and basement.

The echo does everything I need it to and it sounds great, but I wish it had a clock.

Piece of cake to replace my Gen 2 Echo. Music sounds much better & the voice sensitivity is much better. I did have to turn off the ultrasound motion detection b/c it overlayed a weird static across the Alexa voice & the music when played. A quick Google search revealed that some units suffer from this. I'll never use the that feature so NBD. Other than that little issue is been working without a problem for weeks. Just like the old gen 2 worked for years. In fact the gen 2 is just being relocated to a spare room.

Overall is great. Two things I want to suggest for developing teams. Echo can pair with others to become a stereo, but it is only compatible with the same version Echo and Echo Sub. Ideally would be one Echo and two Echo dot. Another thing would be that there should be a separate volume of the Audio and Alexa. Since I used it for audio on my PC and the volume on the PC is fixed, there is only Echo's volume I can change. The Alexa sound would be extremely big and my PC sound would be small, so I either give up Alexa or turn the volume down every single time.

I purchased this one To better manage the smart bulbs instead of using the hub. I have become spoiled using Alexa to turn things on and off throughout the house via smart bulbs plugs or switches it has become an enjoyable thing to not have to get up and go do something when you’re lying in bed. I recently had to return the smart hub due to the fact it would not listen properly and after a couple of months I got frustrated and finally called Amazon was very helpful and had me send it back to them and found that it needed replacement which the replacement arrived within two days. I do enjoy listening to music on these devices throughout the house playing on a group or every one of your connected echo devices can play the same song throughout the house. This is especially helpful during storms  when my dogs who can’t stand the sound of thunder or gunshots the music throughout the house keeps them from hearing it more than they would if it was silent.

Upgraded a 1st generation echo speaker. The system has grown to a pair of Echo Studios with a Echo subwoofer, Echo alarm clock, and then when Amazon offered this at half price I jumped on it to replace the 1st gratin Echo speaker. The sound quality is great along with functional responsiveness -- a great upgrade. At the same time Amazon offered the new 6+ Eero router at a great discount plus offered to buy back the older Eero router. That also greatly improved performance. Overall the Prime Day Sales were great and the value we received was well worth it.

Finally a true high fidelity Echo! Of course it lacks true stereo separation, but that is hardly noticed with the 2 separate tweeters at 45 degree angle to each other.This is a great way to stream music in HD and UHD as Echo 4 plays in this cd-quality format, better than mp3 quality for sure.UPDATE: Voice recognition while loud music is playing is not as good as the 2nd generation, which is very sensitive during loud music or TV. With the TV at normal listening level, I have to almost yell to get the new Echo to hear what I am saying.My opinion is that this one is great for pop music, which doesn't require as great sound as, say, symphonic music. I listened to a Mahler symphony with this Echo and the sound quality was quite good, suitable for background listening to classical. My high fidelity Onkyo system and speakers of course sound better, and a high quality sound system is required for serious classical listening. Still, this is a good unit and replaces my 1st gen living room Echo. The comparison here is phenomenal.The new HD 2009 remastered Beatles albums sound great with Echo 4!Also, it works with non-Amazon music streamers though it requires a paid subscription to Amazon Music HD to access them!I like the globe-shape design. I was surprised at the white power cord, but it didn't bum me out like some reviewers here.It has a jack for a mini-plug that you can plug by wire into separate speakers, tho I haven't tried it.

Update 2:Due to sending back another dot I was able to get a second on prime day for $42 net after trade in.I paired it to the other one so now have a stereo pair. It is indeed sending different signals to the left and right channels based on the music.I think it is pretty good for a home office. I did hear the Studio in the big box store last week and still might add one of those.Update: I would give 4.5 vs.perhaps a 3.8 earlier. It seems to adapt over time by perhaps learning your voice and acoustics as I moved it in the room.I had some credits with Amazon and decided to get this as it was on sale for $80- 25% trade in minus $5 dot trade in. So ~ $55 net. I was considering just getting a Echo Studio but the purpose of this is to sit on my floor and  sometimes listen to music during the work day.  My main Amazon/Alexa music listening to these days is through my Yamaha YAS109 and sometimes my Sonos One.The setup was easy, much better than years ago - just opened the app and it connected. No more, password, pressing two buttons at once.  I would agree that there have been a few ocassions I needed to repeat myself though as others have mentioned.I was surprised by how much bass there was- I am in the process of adjusting the EQ on the app. I have tried it out with some classic rock and disco.  I don't think the unit is earth shattering but for a casual listening experience while playing softly while WFH I think this has a lot of potential.I will see if repositioning it changes my opinion higher. I have a Echo Studio 5- i think this does have clearer vocals .UPDATE: It is sounding better maybe it does recognize the room/small area with my voice.I A/B'd it compared to my Sonos One and obviously one sonos one might sound better but this is decent i can even hear it in the next room where I am writing this.

Don't let the small size fool you. The sound quality on this little death star is crazy.  The sound fills the room without having to go above 80% and practically no distortion.

Now I have to learn to integrate my smart devices.Off to play with my new toy!

Our Echo Tap stopped working so I started to do some research on a replacement. After reading some of the reviews I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this item but went for it anyway. We received a nice discount on the item after trading in the our old echo. As soon as we plugged it in I opened up the app and it connected automatically and started working. It was on shuffle mode for about 10 minutes and just stopped working. It came back online in no time and has been working perfect! The sound is awesome!!! We always have ours on shuffle mode playing music all day and it sounds incredible. Plus you can set the EQ (treble, mids, bass) for your desired taste. This speaker covers the entire spectrum from beautiful deep bass to singing highs. I’m absolutely in love with it and happy we upgraded!! A++

Even Alexa sounds better.  I think they are finally using the built-in AI chip (unless you are in the UK) that is new to the 4th gen echo products to do more of the voice recognition local rather than sending it off to the cloud.  This should be faster responses and hopefully better responses all around. She seems to understand better than even my Echo Show 8.  Also, the music is much richer and crisp.  There is finally some bass from Amazon's smart speakers.  The tweeters are clearer, making like I said Alexa even sound better. LOL

I am amazed at how good the Echo (not Echo Dot) 4th Gen sounds for music.  I purchased the Echo for music while showering.  I'm impressed enough to write this review.  Now, if AMAZON considered reasonable trade-in values for older Echo Dots, I'd consider upgrading all the Dots I have around the house.  This Echo makes me wonder what the Echo Studio sounds like, but I can't bring myself to purchase an Echo Studio due to its cost; I also don't need one because my ""main music room"" has all the gear I need there.UPDATE:I had more than four (4) 2nd-generation DOTs, and tried the ECHO 4th-gen to replace my bathroom DOT for showers.  It works great in there, so I was moved to give the ECHO 4th-gen a positive review and went on to replace four (4) of my 2nd-gen DOTs with the 4th-gen ECHO.  First of all, these ECHO 4th-gens are very sensitive to position in terms of the sound.  I tolerated it.  (They sound much better than the DOTs.)  The MAIN PROBLEM with the ECHO 4th-gen is it DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO LISTEN.  Sometimes the one in the living room didn't even acknowledge I was talking to it!  (You can tell by the light not coming on.)  And oftentimes it wouldn't hear me, and another ECHO or DOT would answer!  So sometimes it wouldn't listen; other times it got the meaning of the words wrong; and yet other times it couldn't negotiate with the other ECHOs and DOTs ""within earshot"" as to which device should respond!  If this ECHO was defective, then all of them are defective: they all do the same goofed-up-listening thing.  I have since replaced the living-room ECHO 4th-gen with the old 2nd-gen DOT.  Now I have sane listening in my living room again.  I ""complained"" to AMAZON (oh how I complained) via ""I have feedback"" of course to no avail: AMAZON would have to acknowledge their design goof, which they continue to sell ""as is.""  There is something wrong with the voice pickup in these 4th-gen ECHOs.  It was aggravating enough for me to ""downgrade"" the 4th-gen ECHO to a 2nd-gen DOT.

This is my favorite of 3 dots because of the improved sound. Being a musician I like balance bass to treble and this little guy is pretty good for that though bass is a bit heavy. Has good clarity for its' size. Otherwise works about like my other dots.  I have not needed internal hub but it seems like a nice addition.

i got my very first Alexa product a little over a year ago - the echo dot. the dot was a great introduction to alexa and all of its capabilities. however, i did notice that the sound was lacking, and as much as i loved the multiple pairing for listening to music when having parties, i found myself reaching for my JBL charge speaker more than the echo dots simply because of the music/bass quality.I am SO GLAD i upgraded to the echo because the sound is LIGHTYEARS OF DIFFERENCE. I am a big music/music quality person and these have made a massive difference. I rarely even use my JBL speaker now because the quality in these is actually even better than that!!i do wish there was sort of a travel option like most other bluetooth speakers, since sometimes i like to take them outside or to an area where plugs are not accessible. i wish there was a way around this that was not overly complicated or required purchasing another object.  Otherwise i would recommend to anyone who loves alexa products but was missing the sound quality of the dot.to summarize: for someone who is not super into music, the echo dot is a more ""appropriate"" size and music quality is good enough.for someone who appreciates/is into music: the echo is SO worth the investment. it is significantly bigger than the dot, but i dont find that it looks ridiculous, just takes some getting used to - because the bigger size is so worth the sound quality difference.

Purchased this 4th gen echo at a great price, but soon realized the voice recognition is not nearly good as my 1st gen echo had. It does have very good sound and performs Alexa functions correctly, once you can get it to hear and understand you!  If there is any background noise, like a fan or pellet stove running you will probably have to repeat your command.

I've been using the second generation echo and dot for many years. They were ok, but the sound wasn't very great. I took a chance and bought 2 of the new echos and what a difference. I've paired them with my older echos and dots and I love the sound throughout the house. Also they are much easier to navigate on the Alexa app.

Does exactly what I need for it to do. Excellent job of recognizing commands and requests. Good at identifying individual voices for custom commands. Overall, much better than I expected. Sound quality is as good as can be expected from the size. Someday hope to try it with the subwoofer for my family room.

Sound quality as stereo Echo pair is great on my WiFi 6 Orbi network. They don’t interfere with my Bower & Wilkins Formation sound system.My only complaint is Bluetooth airplay (Apple Music, Tidal) allows my iPhone to connect to only one Echo at a time so it’s not possible to grab them and go as a portable stereo sound system. They need WiFi and the Alexa App to pair them.Amazon Music App works well and if you have the Formation, Apple Music and Tidal skills installed in the Amazon Alexa App you can figure out how to tell Alexa to play music from any skill source to any Alexa sound room or Formation sound stage.I will test them with WiFi off to see it it’s possible to set them up and pair them using only Bluetooth and the iPhone Apps to see if I can get AirPlay to stream Bluetooth from Apple and Tidal music Apps to both Echo’s as a pair. I swear my initial setup outside on the deck had my Airplaying to both speakers in stereo. The next day, my iPhone rejected the saved Bluetooth device and when I detected and reattached I was able to connect to each speaker one at a time with no way to hear stereo mode without Amazon Music or telling Alexa via WiFi.How they seemed to work via Airplay outside Amazon Music/Alexa on Bluetooth then wouldn’t the next day is a mystery.Then how my Amazon Music App seemed to be broken with no way of changing speakers and other quirky things suddenly got better after I agreed to purchase Music HD is another mystery. Suddenly an AirPlay came alive in Amazon Music that now allows me to AirPlay to any Amazon sound room and also my Formation sound stages.I haven’t tried Bluetooth to one Echo then 3.5mm wire to second Echo to see if they work as left and right speaker. I hear this works, but it doesn’t allow a Echo Sub to connect in this Bluetooth setup.

I bought a 2nd generation echo when they first came out years ago. I keep it in our kitchen and use it daily for music, news and general inquiries. I have also setup some smart switches so I can control lights using voice through Alexa. When I upgraded to smart thermostats I purchased one that has Alexa built in. I noticed recently that the Echo was not interpreting my requests very well and frequently would not play a song after a request. I assumed it was just getting old so decided to upgrade to this latest device that was on sale during Prime days. I assumed there would be a significant improvement in sound quality but it is marginally better. not enough to justify replacement. I find I need to yell at this echo for it to recognize my voice, the old one worked much better. Lastly, I moved my old 2nd gen echo into the upstairs bedroom thinking I could play music up there but Alexa does not support that. Appears you need to have an individual Amazon account for each device if you want to have it play Spotify. I have a Spotify family account and have no interest in paying for Amazon music premium as well. I am disappointed with this and now I have two echoes that are unreliable when it comes to playing any requested music. I am seriously going to look at Google now.

A much larger footprint than the original cylinder version, or any of the “dots” currently being offered. The technology and functionality that has been put into the unit as impressive, however it struggles to understand requests and often gets them completely wrong. Since all the other echo devices in the house do not share similar struggles, I’m assuming it’s the device itself. I’ve tried relocating the unit to areas where it might hear requests easier however, it still seems to struggle. The overall sound is probably the best out of all the Echo stand alone devices so far. In the end, it’s pworth a purchase especially if it’s on sale.

I purchased this Echo to replace my 2nd generation Echo. My main complaint with this device is I must be directly facing it in order for it to acknowledge my requests and MOST of the time I have to make the request multiple times, even when directly facing it.  Now, my 2nd generation, I could…and still can, because it’s in a new location…hears everything I say, all the time, regardless of the direction I am facing.  Going back to the Dot, it sounds good when playing music but the difference between that and my old Echo is not that substantial, to me, no WOW! factor.

I bought an Echo 4th gen and an Echo Dot (4th Gen) in a package.  I've been using them for 9 months now. These devices do play music from Amazon Prime Music account but the Alexa software is pretty buggy.  Example:  For months I couldn't get the two paired Echo devices to play Amazon music (or anything else) on Everywhere group.  Then recently I was able to get that to work, BUT Alexa would only play one song from Amazon music then shut all devices down.  I made sure network connectivity was not the problem. Both Echo devices  are paired and connected to the same wi-fi network.  My Everywhere Group includes both devices.  I could play music all day long on a single device at a time.  Today (9/29/2021) I found that if you start initially playing Amazon music on Everywhere, it will shut off all devices after one song, BUT, if you initially start playing NPR/Kuow (from iHeart Radio) on Everywhere, you can then switch to Amazon music and songs will continue to play.  This is what I mean by ""buggy"".Now for the rest.  The other Alexa features like Lists, Routines, Chore Chart (blueprint), Task Tracker (blueprint) are so far pretty useless.  What I wanted to do was use Alexa to help us  (two adults) manage our time, like keep track of chores, with daily reminders, and keep track of tasks lists for each of us.  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to use more than a single ""list""  or tracker and it better be for a single person.  I created two lists (using Lists & Notes, not Blueprints), one a shopping list, one a to-do list.  Alexa had trouble keeping these lists separated, and adding/removing items at least from voice commands.  I also tried creating a couple of Skills using Chore Chart blueprint and Task List blueprint.  These also did not work for multiple people, and you cannot edit the items without logging into the Blueprints web so it's not very useful for a daily Task List that needs to be dynamic.Bottom line, it has taken 9 months to get this far. I was willing to put some learning time in, but not have to take a class or hire a technician just to get things working.  I find the Echo hardware are adequate speakers for me, but Alexa software is not.  Amazon's online documentation is woefully inadequate, difficult to find and very general.  I did not try the Help & Feedback from the iOS Alexa app since I find reading documentation on a phone screen difficult.  The forums are sometimes helpful if you use suggestions cautiously.  I  have spent a lot of time trying to get Alexa features working, and my lack of success does not make me happy.  I admit my expectations may have been too high.

This was my first amazon speaker coming from a Google based home i was attracted to the integrated hub and design. As a speaker it's really nice the sound is much better than my older bose soundtouch systems and my Google speakers which is strange because it's so much smaller its hilarious ive found to embrace the size as an advantage and am getting used to it the up firing speaker placement seems to work better than forward firing and I feel it fill my room better than my previous speakers at a comparable volume.  The volume it self is crazy loud i don't see my self ever using it anywhere over 75% its nice to have the option to go that loud i guess but the volume controls are some what limited unless you resort to voice commands since the app is pretty laggy. The app is something that definitely needs work but thats expected it can be frustrating at times and I did have some issues durring set up where my speaker would lose connection with the app causing a longer than expected set up. I've also noticed lag when using the app to control music or audio books with the app sometimes crashing and causing the speaker to stop playing but I've only experienced this when using the alexa app and using the specific app like audible and amazon music and controlling it from there has been much smother. The voice commands work perfectly its much more responsive than my older generation Google speaker and I haven't had any times where it has misunderstood me or been unable to complete a voice command. Voice commands is where the echo really shines its so convenient and responsive with executing every task ive asked it whether controlling my fire tv, playing music, searching for specific information, and making calls has all worked flawlessly voice commands is by far the best way to control the echo. Overall I'm pretty pleased with my purchase changing eco system i was a bit concerned but ive had a mostly positive experience so far and am enjoying my new speaker.

I've owned 3 Echo Dot devices for around 2+ years.  Thought they were very handy and speedy enough for streaming music and accomplishing other things in a smart home.  They even work well to answer trivia questions should you have a curious mind wishing to learn about things.  Sound quality was ok but nothing to write home about.  Connecting them to a good quality Bluetooth speaker was the ticket.  I've found the best solution was to connect the external Bluetooth speaker to the Echo Dot with a 3.5 mm quality cable (if possible) and that would then leave the Bluetooth connection available for a phone or tablet.  Otherwise, you waste the cable audio input and defeat other features available through the Bluetooth Network connection to the Echo Dot.  I digress...The Echo 4th Gen has very respectable sound quality even at low volume.  The Alexa software with bass, midrange, and treble adjustments enable fine tuning of the sound quality.  The  3.5mm connection port is now both in and out.  Same thing for Bluetooth - in or out.  The WiFi capability is further enhanced with an upgrade to AC class so it can connect at 800 + megabit for streaming Hi-Res audio with no lag at all.  A bit overkill for audio only.  I imagine Amazon device engineers figured AC 5 Ghz would be necessary since it also has Higbee hub capabilities that may need lots of processing and the associated network bandwidth capabilities to other devices.  I could go on and on about this new Gen4 Echo.  At the current holiday sale price with free included options, it is a huge STEAL.  I've purchased 5 of these devices as Christmas presents.  4 of them with the 2 smart Hue Led lightbulbs and a fifth one to use as a stereo pair for a relative.  She is going to love the sound of it playing Amazon Music HD through that pair.  What a very nice inexpensive ""smart"" stereo.  All of it with voice command capability.

What should have taken about 3 minutes, ended up taking about an hour.  I was unable to pair the two echos I bought, despite help from tech support.

Also, it would nice if Amazon would ship black plugs/cords with black echos.  It's a small issue, but the white cords don't match the echos and they stand out.

This speaker rivals my Bose SoundLink Revolve II. If it was portable, it would be a great candidate to replace it! For the price and sound, everyone should replace their outdated Echo Dots with this one. The highs and lows are very good, it won't replace your home stereo system, but it is nice for a bedroom or office that you need music in. My only issues are that I have Alexas in multiple rooms, so they all try to pick up your voice at the wrong time and it is not portable without the battery base. This product is highly recommended.

I already have the Echo Gen 3 but wanted to upgrade to the Echo Gen 4. What so many people don’t mention is, if you’re starting off to make your home a smart home, you’ll maybe need a Bridge or Hub that can utilize Zigbee, Z-Power or Thread. Google Hub isn’t actually a hub that can support those radios and the hubs can be about $50-$100 on their own. So Echo 4 comes with a hub to use for smart locks, bulbs, cameras, doorbells etc and it has Airplay!!Sound of the device is pretty amaze considering the price. Deep rich bass, nice highs and mids. No distortion. I had to put a grip to the bottom of the 4 because it would vibrate off the shelf if I didn’t, but I was listening to VERY bass heavy music (Bassnectar)Set up was as easy as plugging it in and opening the app. I think that was it. Once it was set up the app let me know the 4 wanted to set up my lights and with a click, it set both of them up!Alexa routines are amazing for automation  Alexa, Good night  turns my lights off, activates my alarms, schedules my lights to gradually come on to a specific brightness gradually over a set time, tells me my appointments for tomorrow and the weather, tells me sweet Dreams, and plays sounds of rain.I haven’t had to use the buttons on it yet. Voice works too well for me to need to press buttons yet.Drop in works very well and both the caller and I can hear one another near perfectlyEcho 4 and 3 aren’t able to be paired together to make a stereo set, but you can use the 3 and 4 in the same house, group, room and they work like they should.Still reading up on the tons of things I can get automated now that I have a hub, smart speaker with airplay. Set up is darn close to being as if it was ready the moment I opened its box and plugged it in

Gen 1 had light at top of device and could be seen from across the room. Gen 4 has light at bottom of device. If anything is around Alexa then you don’t know if it heard the wake word unless you are right at the device. Gen 1 Alexa has volume control on top, it only takes a turn to silence it when you call into a radio show and you need Alexa silenced. Gen 4 Alexa has to have minus button pushed multiple times to silence it. Nothing wrong with Gen 1 Alexa except after market battery backup went bad and I couldn’t find a new one, still using Gen 1 just don’t unplug it. Have battery backup for new Gen 4 so I can take to other parts of house or outside. Gen 4 has very good sound and looks good sitting anywhere in house. Love the base sound.

What's not to love?Well. ,maybe the ball shape amd larger footprint, but that is just quibbling.When it comes down to value for the dollar, Generation 4 is awesome!Getting more technology for the same price over previous generations (built in hub and more advanced local processing)the hub feature alone is worth the price of entry, especially if you can time your purchase with a sale, and there will be more sales coming up if amazon has a second prime day and definitely as the holidays approach. And as capable as it is, and as compatible with as many things as it is, they push software updates all the time.Excellent voice recognition, quicker than previous version.And the sound is MUCH better than previous generations.Don't let anyone tell you (like those you tube reviews) ""it is the same driver""> IT IS NOTWhat they mean is, ""it is the same diameter"". But there is SO much more to a speaker than just the diameter.The cone is lighter and stiffer, it has a die cast aluminum ""basket"" instead of a stamped sheet metal one. I haven't taken the speaker completely apart so I haven't checked the voice coil, but the magnet is also much heavier. The surround (annulus) seems more pliant.All this results in better sound.This model has two dome tweeters for slightly better mids and highs and better directionality in both mono and especially stereo modes.Of course it isn't a replacement for a home stereo, and it is was never meant to be. It's just meant to fill a room with sound when you're not critically listening.Another thing is that the new generation also is made out of mostly recycled parts.Of course Alexa is much better than siri and almost on par with goog when doing queries and she's getting better every day

You can't just make a speaker and assume that people will be DIYing their own floorstands.Are we supposed to leave them on the floor or just haphazardly spaced on any tables in random locations And not everyone is going to want to roll the dice and start knocking holes into their walls to mount them. Come on, Amazon! If you're going to push into the home audio space you have to have the peripherals ready for your customers. So many great products and services... it really surprises me when concerns like this are neglected.If anyone out there has had success finding attractive white floorstands that are compatible with these, I'd appreciate details on them.Also- if anyone from Amazon is paying attention: I'd love to add a sub but where is the white version? Many home decors today aren't interested in a large black cylinder sticking out like a sore thumb. You have white Echos- why not a white Echo sub? Make it s sphere as well while you're at it.Functionality I'd love to see added: Not just 2.1 home theater support. 3.1 and 5.1 would be lovely.

Then it was by mistake.Unfortunately i just received a notice that the music is going up in price. It is frustrating since I cant even get it to play all day.

You have to do everything just right and then some for everywhere music playing to work or everything starts skipping around and pausing and turns into a garbled mess that falls all apart. Then you have to start resetting things.The tricks I found for having or getting things working again have mostly to do with how I am disconnecting everywhere music playing.To properly disconnect everywhere music playing First have to disconnect everywhere in Amazon music app (casting button), then second have to say Alexa disconnect everywhere.In order to have full control When starting everywhere music playing again have to start from Amazon music app (with everywhere still disconnected) so it is only playing on that device. Then hit the casting button and tap everywhere.You can pause and continue playing everywhere with voice but it has to be very specific by saying Alexa pause music everywhere, Then saying Alexa continue playing on everywhere.If I have done the disconnect process correctly, I can usually pick back up without the stuttering and skipping and pausing of buggy Amazon music with echoes playing everywhere.Once the buggy issues start from not disconnecting properly, I have to use the Alexa app to unpair all the speaker groups then re-pair them again.Worst case scenario I have to also reset my Network, which is an eero router working with all these eero built-in echoes. So it’s unplug everything including modem and eero router and all eero echoes (I have 5). Then it’s plug in the modem wait for it to boot up all the way then plug in the eero router wait for it to boot up all the way, and then plug in all the eero echoes.I use an iPad for Amazon music app for tapping casting button and another device for Alexa app open to what is now playing because that’s the only way you can control the slider for the music.Take extremely buggy Amazon music and then add everywhere music playing with these echoes and you’ve got a catastrophe. Nothing just works and it’s all a headache even when you’ve got it figured out.

This is my fifth Alexa device in my home, and I've got models from all generations. I had read that the audio quality on this model was far superior to anything before, and I'm sorry to say that I don't agree.The device does everything Alexa related very well, recognizes my commands, executes routines, and gives me notifications. Reviews and sales literature talked about how much better this device sounded than others, and I have to disagree. I would hope that a device with one base speaker and two tweeters would provide more dynamic range and higher quality bass and treble reproduction, but the device just doesn't match the hype.I understand this isn't the Sonos device and it's not priced like a Sonos device, but it's not much better than the second generation unit I have, and there's not enough control in the Alexa app to tweak the sound to make it sound better.It does everything it's supposed to, I just wish it would do it with a better sound definition.

Almost everything about this Echo 4th Gen is a step backward. Sound has a little deeper bass, otherwise I like the sound of the Echo Plus 2nd gen better.  It does not respond to voice commands as well as the Plus.  It is like it cannot hear you as well.  Having the illuminated ring at the bottom where you cannot see it is just dumb, unless you have it on a glass shelf above head height.  Concerning Echo/Alexa in general, I cannot believe they have not made it any smarter in all these years.  Instead, they are putting all their energy into marketing gimmicks.  If I say the exact name of a song I want to hear, sometimes it will choose one with a similar name rather than the exact title I requested.  Stop doing what you think I want and start doing exactly what I say.  You should only play an alternative if I stated a title that does not exist or was not stated correctly.  I get ""Hmmm, I dont know the answer to that"" to some pretty simple questions as well.  They have it evolved to the knowledgeability of a nine year old and have not evolved it since.  I may begin to look at alternatives, as I cannot support this stupidity much longer.  In large companies, Marketing typically always has the power over Engineering.  I know this, as I am a retired Engineer from a large fortune 50 company.  It is apparent that Amazon is the same way.  I can hear the debate now... ""It won't work as well that way.  Yeah, but it is shaped like a ball and that is cool"".  Start selling the Echo plus again and I may buy one or two more.  Otherwise I am done.

The sound quality is pretty good considering the price, though a the track separation and sound separation is mediocre since it's not a stereo setup.

This is the best sounding of the Echo devices to date, a lot more bass than gen 2 or 3. I have 2 Echo 1st gen units and this one is about twice as fast in answering as they are - if you can get it to respond to your voice. If there is any background noise at all - radio, TV, fan, or AC etc., it is hard to get it to recognize my request. With a gen 1 and this one in the same room, the gen 1 hears me better. For music though, it is VERY good, I have 2 and, overall, really like them.

Listen to your playlists with better sound than ever.  Plus - this new Echo has a bionic ear: I've asked Alexa something from another room and she heard me loud and clear!  Highly recommended.  I put my old echo in the garage and with my others connected to my ""everywhere"" group I can listen to music from throughout my home and even into the backyard!  Music to my (and your) ears!

As a BT wireless speaker, the Echo 4 delivers very pleasant sound - not audiophile quality, but at this price, I have no complaints.  I did find it a bit muddy/boomy at its default setting, but very easy to adjust the bass/mids/treble to get a balance that sounds nice.  I like streaming Spotify as well as use this as an external speaker for my home laptop.I like the overall build, and the volume easily fills a small to mid-sized room (my home-office).Alexa does respond faster on this with the new processer than it does on my SIL's Echo Dot 3.  I've had no issues with set-up, pairing etc.  I've had no problems with Alexa ""hearing"" my commands even when streaming music at a moderate volume. I enjoy using Alexa for getting notifications, weather, and general information.  I don't have any home devices yet to run via Alexa but plan on exploring that in the near future.  All in all I enjoy using this, the price is decent, and I envision expanding my uses for the Echo 4.

Okay, so I have 2 of these paired with a Fire 4K TV stick.If I'm only playing music through Amazon's music service... incredible sound and the volume is more than enough for any sane person to thoroughly enjoy.  For reference, we listen at about Volume 4.BUT...When it comes to watching a television show through the Fire 4K stick... it's so frustrating it makes me want to return them.  100% of the time, we set ""Volume 10"", which is maximum volume.  And even *that* doesn't always allow us to hear the dialogue coming through the show.I've tried SO many settings to fix it.  I've paired and unpaired countless times.AND there's more.For some reason, we have to reboot our 4K Firestick every single day before we watch a show.  Otherwise, at some point during the day, it disconnects from the speakers for TV.  And only for TV.  Because if we ask for music, it works just time, every time.Moral of the story:  happy with them for music.  Terrible as a speaker system for television.(Wife is a travel nurse.  We move every 3 months.  I was *hoping* they would be an incredible solution to save space vs. a full audio system.  I was wrong.)

I bought this Echo to replace the clock radio since FM reception in my area is spotty at best.

CONS:Unless you want to pay another FEE to listen to your expensive SiriusXM subscription with Alexa, don't buy this. But if you're just getting it to use for listening to music, then there's Another ""monthly subscription"" to listen to MORE music on ALL devices at the same time.That's the biggest issue I have with these as that's is the main reason I bought these. I am so tired of everything having to have a ""monthly/added fee.""Pros:Nice sound. We listen to music, it will play local radio stations on it for FREE, and it will play Amazon music stations, you just can't listen to it at the same time on ALL devices (unless you pay for it--we already pay for Siriusxm--not going to pay more).I also listen to audiobooks. The sound levels are a little more than a few decibels off from music to books--so you either can't hear it, or you blow your eardrums.We don't do much else with it except ask it questions once in awhile.

This was a Christmas gift for my 98 year old Grandmother.  My wife and i have an earlier echo generation and love it.  In my grandmother's case she loves the music, and help with reminders.  The problem arose during setup.  To create an account for my grandmother's echo it was required she had an email address.  She is 98 and does not use the internet nor has an email account.  So i elected to include it with my account.  All was good until we found out only one device could stream Amazon Music at a time.  My grandmother's Echo came with a promotional 6 month Amazon Music Premium feature while my wife and i only use the free Amazon Music with our Prime Account.  Suddenly, it became almost a competition where our echo would play one song then request if wanted to move the streaming service to our device.  We would have it and then lose it as my Grandmother at her location did the same thing.  I called Amazon about the problem and spoke with someone with a heavy Indian accent who claimed they could resolve the problem and after 20 minutes dropped the call.  I tried again and got a second Indian representative who was brash, rude, continually talking over me and saying ""just let your 98 year old Grandmother listen to her music!"".  Giving up i tried to politely end the call, where the representative asked if there was anything else he could help with.....  I was hoping i would get a survey about the call, but instead i got an form email from the rep saying it was a pleasure talking with me and he was glad he could help....  No survey.  On the same day this conversation occurred my wife got a charge on her credit card from Amazon for a Prime Membership.  When checking the credit card purchase online i clicked on the merchant who charged her and i was taken to my Amazon Prime Account.....  I did  not purchase a second Prime account and most assuredly not on my wife's credit card.  Well we got that charge cancelled but are still wondering what happened and are living with the competing Echo's.  Yet to be figured out.  The device is very nice....  The Customer Service to help us set it up...  Not so much.

 I'm upgrading from a 2nd Gen, and the sound is just SO much better! My only issue is with the problem I'm having pairing with my Fire TV, which is an ""Alexa"" issue and not a problem with the Echo itself. Now that I hear it, I'll be buying a 2nd to pair together!

While the sound quality of our new generation 4 echo is good, we feel that the our generation 2 was better.

My 1st echo needed to be replaced. I have echo shows in the house but I wanted something smaller with great sound. I also did not have a need for a display.

I am OK with the appearance, though the round ball like profile is too overwhelming, I much prefer the Echo dot. My first complaint is that the newer ball shaped device take more space, LOTS more space. and my MAIN complaint is that Alexa 4gen keeps loosing wifi connections and I need to jump through hoops to get it to reconnect. Sounds like I am a winner, and I may be. Take into consideration that I have limited mobility and un plugging and re-plugging back in the modem, router and ECHO and then accessing the app in my phone to reconnect is just a pain in the ass. I would like to return the ball for a dot, but I doubt that is going to happen. thank you.

Having had an Echo 4th Gen for a year now for casual listening, and just added a pair plus sub for a 2.1 setup, I’ve been able to take this new model through the range of volume and genres fairly thoroughly. It is GREAT for aforementioned casual listening, typically with good voice recognition and response. It is NOT quite as accomplished with a stereo pairing for more focused (and higher volume) listening. The Sub really does well with rounding out the frequencies Echo can achieve in music, though it’s no heavy-hitter. Then again, it’s a 6” woofer and not designed to be that, so that’s ok. The Echos themselves do well up until about a 70-75% volume level, then start showing hints of distorting, even harshness. You can adjust the EQ settings, but even bringing down the treble does not resolve the top end being overwhelmed with upper volume.Thus, for a typical/casual music listener that’s not going to push these too much, it’s probably the best all-around Echo! For anyone wanting more of a performance envelope for music reproduction, try the Studio version (or a pair of them!), I’d say.

I have had this Echo for over a year now. The sound quality is great and I think each generation gets better. However, the 4th generation microphones can't hear most of the time. I've tried multiple different locations to see if that would help and always get the same results. My 3rd generation Echo dots in other rooms respond before this one will. Once, the Echo finally responds after saying ""Alexa"" 2 or 3 times it then doesn't hear my request so then I have to start all over again. Alexa...silence.. Alexa again...still silent.. Alexa one more time...hey finally a response! Sound a bit to familiar? This must be the teenager version of the Echo...lol! All in all it's a great sounding speaker I just wished it could hear better.

I have this along with a few echo Echo dots. The big echo is about ten feet away from my regular seat on the couch, and the echo dot is about thirty feet away, give or take, in the dining area on our open floor plan downstairs. The dot always hears me better than the big echo does. Always. I seldom have to raise my voice to the dot but I do for the echo. It does understand me okay when it hears me, though. Most of the time I wind up talking to the dot in the kitchen, though, because it hears me better, and only speak to the Echo when I want it to play music.That said, the sound quality is noticeably better with the bigger echo, especially when it comes to bass. The dot is good, especially for a casual listener like me, but if you want better bass the echo is a good option. In our little condo it's loud to me at volume 6/10 and we generally keep the volume at 3 or 4.It has a temperature sensor inside which is kinda fun but we don't have a smart thermostat so it's not a big selling point for me. I'm new to smart home stuff, so I haven't bothered figuring out the ZigBee thing yet.I bought it on Prime Day, and for what I paid then I'm content. If you already have a dot and you're just looking for better sound, though, it might be worth it to you to spend the extra on the Echo Studio. We don't have it but a relative does, and the sound out of that is really nice.

I found a voice recognition less accurate than the previous echo. I found this to be a bit disappointing as I got used to the quality of the voice recognition and the previous version. the voice recognition quality appeared to degrade after an update. I do hope they fix this. The sound quality however is excellent.  I've been using it with basic Amazon music service and that's been more than enough for me. I have multiple devices so when I tell it to play music everywhere I hear music throughout my home playing simultaneously. It also connects to various podcasts and online radio stations.One feature that I do like is the built-in thermostat. I'm able to use that to trigger other  devices such as a portable heater, which are plugged into smart plugs, to turn off and on in a room when the temperature is above or below a certain range.The ability to call people through the device is that nice bonus.i It is not using your cell phone which I found to be a bit creepy but it will put your cell phone number as a number that is being dialed so it is effectively spoofing your phone. Basically you could put any phone number there in the account online  to be dialing from and it will use it.The user interface for Alexa integration is quite frankly confusing. I write computer systems for a living it took me quite a while to figure out the integration. I think the average user will give up on many of the integration features because of this difficulty. I should be able to talk to the device directly to create a routine and not be clicking through an application with confusing menus.Overall it's still a great piece of technology and I highly recommend it.

(Update):  Amazon Customer support acknowledged the defect and sent a replacement as the product was under warranty. The new one is working fine so far (day 1) ----I have owned echo since the 1st gen released.  This one is a significant regression when it comes to voice recognition.  Really feel pathetic trading in my first gen for this. Kids stopped using Alexa as they get frustrated that the device doesn't recognize their instructions as well as it did before. Even the echo dot I have upstairs perform better than these.  Amazon does not do a great job of support for the devices.  They did remote diagnostics, sw upgrade etc remotely and eventually said I need to send this for repair which could take anywhere up to 3 months.  Not worth the time and effort.

I primarily got this for the smart hub to use my smart lights with it, and also the upgraded sound quality.  I had a the Echo Gen 1 from 2015 and really like it and still do.  My biggest two complaints with this one that the older one didn't have was that sometimes this Gen 4 will ignore my command to stop the music and keep playing and second that when I ask it to play music it will play on my echo dot 4th gen or the other way around, on the echo dot 4th gen I ask for music and it plays on this echo 4th gen.  Never had that problem with the older gen 1.  A minor complaint is that I can't now stream two different sirius xm stations on the two echo I have or two different apple music streams.  They now say it is playing on another device and I have top upgrade my plan to do this.  Never had that problem with the older echo gen 1.  But I do like the sound better and the smart hub is great.

Wish it would act like a normal echo when i tell it to play music on a specific speaker in the house. But apparently because it is the premium sound one it will only play on that speaker, even when i tell it to play in the bathroom like all the other echos do.

Update: I gave more stars back,After this writing this review they called me up to give me a discount on the replacement. I was just about to purchase a new one when they called. I couldn't handle the bad sound it was giving on my favorite songs.  I like that they did that, but still make sure you pay attention to the sound and get more warranty or something. Bought the last one in Sept. of 2021 and it broke by June of 2022.  I had these less than a year. I never raise the volume past 6 most days... over time the sub just stop producing good sound and at some point I'm screaming at it to hear me. I have the bass on 0 and it still have that blown out sound. Like what happened? I'm sure they plan for them to break after a few months so you have to consider buying a new one. My whole house have one in every room or section and I'm thinking about tossing them all out and getting google just because you can whisper to those and they hear you. I also have flex throughout and and set them up to connect to the main echos to respond. I mostly use them for music throughout my place. Very disappointed in how bad they aged in less than a year.

I love Alexa. It might be more accurately described as a love/hate relationship, but at the end of the day, I Adore that spicy bish. I love asking Alexa  strange questions or just throwing out song requests or a reminder or timer throughout my day, I utilize the crap out of her! Alexa answers are hit and miss, I do receive a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that"" but all in all the idea behind Alexa is sound. I have owned at least 1 Echo and an echo dot (if available) since its inception, and continue to be impressed with the utility of it. This generation of Echo has been a real disappointment to me. While Alexa is becoming more fluid in this iteration,  in some ways it feels like a rather large step back from its predecessors.  Let's talk about this generations audio, shall we? I dislike that when using verbal commands to Alexa for volume up or volume down, it's  very basic and uses a 1-10 system. This can be modified using the plus or minus sign on the device itself, or using the Alexa app on phones (which, to its credit, allows for a 1% to 100% sliding scale to get the desired volume). However, if you are like me and want to be able to say ""Alexa, set volume to 22%"" Alexa will set the volume to the nearest  1-10 volume, in this case, it would set the Echo to volume 2. As an audiophile this feels clunky and lacks ease of use I've come to expect from Echo devices. The sound quality is alright, but I miss the 360 degree sound that previous generations gave me. Fourth generation Echo's also lack music clarity, and the bass is not impressive in the least.Next up, the shape, sigh. This 4th generation Echo looks like a crystal ball and takes up more space while also being a lot more noticeable. Perhaps this is intentional, but I prefer the more discreet shape of the 3rd generation. I am not impressed with them doing collaborations with designers like Diane Von Furstenberg when so many more necessary features like better audio quality and the Echo's voice sensitivity are sorely lacking. I'd love to see Amazon do a partnership with a company like Boss, to give us useful upgrades and higher audio quality.

The biggest problem with any thing Audio is that it’s not even like  what I thought it would be as far as good sound especially when you’re playing music .

This surprisingly weighty little Alexa ball is quite a step up from past Echos, particularly when it comes to sound quality. This little wonder provides plenty of bass and rich tones to fill a room. What's more, its voice recognition is marvelous and I'm guessing the spherical shape of the unit has a lot to do with that. Even while playing music at high volume, it recognizes my commands. No need to shout over the music. (It's almost scary how well it hears, despite significant, competing sounds.)Connectivity to my Alexa SmartHome was quick and seamless. Easy-peasy. I recommend purchasing the recharging mount/stand, as shown in the pic and available here on Amazon. Simply unplug the AC cord after charging and the unit is portable/wireless anywhere within the home where WiFi is accessible--for up to five hours.All in all, the Echo 4th Gen exceeds my expectations. As for issues of privacy that have surrounded this device and others since their inception? There are a number of ways to protect yourself if you are concerned--ways that I won't delineate here. Do your settings homework and you'll see that Amazon can learn as little or as much about your household as you permit. As for me and mine? I employ a few such settings but I'm not paranoid about it. The benefits that the Alexa suite of products provide me far outweigh any concerns I might have about privacy intrusion. Again, take the time to learn about the product and configure your devices to suit your needs AND protect your family's information. Both objectives are realistic.

I bought 3 of these when they went on sale to replace a stereo pair of Echo Dots (3rd gen) and a single Dot.The stereo pair are on par (base actually feels better) than a pair of $200 Studio Echos bought back in 2020. Overall audio quality is excellent compared to the Studios.Also, the response time is noticeably faster. Using the wake word (I use different ones for different units) causes these 4th gen Echos to light and listen so much faster than all previous gens. The single 4th gen Echo replaced a 3rd gen puck that would need to be unplugged and plugged back in regularly as it became less and less response to the ""Alexa"" wake word. This is important to me, since I use Alexa to control lights (WeMo/Lutron), fans (Big Ass Fans), thermostats (Nest) and stream audio throughout my home.Having gone through generations of Echos (starting with Gen1), it's apparent that some internal changes make a bigger difference in performance than is typically revealed by Amazon and in most reviews (which focus on audio quality).Overall, really impressed with this latest version.

I bought two of these to set up a wireless stereo setup. The bass is insane, to the point where you have to turn it down to hear much of anything else. The midrange is recessed to a nearly objectionable amount, but for the price it's tolerable, I guess.Amazon must do something with spatial audio because the stereo image on these is also insane. Very nice.As for the Alexa thing, I already have four other Alexa eavesdroppers. This is more a review of Echo as an audio device and stereo deal. Short version: don't do it.Linking my two echoes together was easy enough, but one got put in  one ""room"" and one unassigned, and after days I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that other Echo into the same ""room"", but it's just a labeling thing. Connecting them in stereo was simple. Then came the issues.First... these only work in stereo if you stream from an official Amazon(tm) service. That means Amazon music (and probably Prime video). So if you wanted to use these in stereo for TV or YouTube... nope. Doesn't work.And even using this with Amazon Music... is problematic. I have to connect to the pair twice before they start playing, but I can deal with that. But then the Amazon Music app might reset and then I have zero control of what's playing. The speakers keep going on the playlist, somehow, but the app completely loses any sense of what's going on. So seeing what's playing or skipping songs isn't do-able.And as a Zigbee hub... well one works great, but Alexa has no sense of common controls like changing light colors in a group (only individually). It's a great piece of hardware stymied by limited software. There's no reason Alexa couldn't crib notes from every other zigbee app out there, and use my wifi network to stream audio data from one Echo to the others when I bluetooth connect to it. These would make a great little theater setup if they got that to work and kept the sale pricing.Of course, I don't use the thing for Alexa at all, which should probably say something about the strange product planning involved as well. Kudos to the hardware guys, but what is the software group up to?

Replaced my 1st gen Alexa because after moving it could not reconnect to a new WiFi network. Great sound. We listen to it Pandora or Amazon music daily. Nice to have the severe weather notifications feature. We tried it with our new Samsung TV and results are mixed. Mainly the Alexa feature is more annoying than helpful with the TV.

Since wink has pretty much gone belly up and started charging to use it I decided it was time to put it to bed. Since I already have numerous dots, spots, and shows I decided the best idea was to go with the echo hub. I have a Phillips hue hub and numerous bulbs which connected very easily. I also have several switches that were mostly Z-wave so those all had to be replaced with Kasa zigbee switches which also installed very easily. My back door lock is a Schlage Connect but it was also Z-wave so I had to replace that with a Schlage Connect zigbee and that installed much easier than the Z-wave. I have to agree with everyone that it’s ridiculous they ship a white power cable with a charcoal unit. Luckily my cable is mostly hidden. I thought I could possibly use a power cable from one of the old dots but they all work on different amp outputs. I also have to agree that this thing needs an improvement on it’s microphone. I have this installed in my kitchen and normally have to call it my name several times to get it to respond whereas one of my shows is in the living room and I can easily get it to respond from the kitchen. Overall it was much easier to install and maintain than the wink hub. A word of advice. If you have a wink hub and you want to change to this hub make sure that you delete all of your devices from your wink app, unlink everything in the wink settings, remove the app from your phone and disable the wink skill. Otherwise Alexa Will reinstall them automatically and you will have to delete them all every time it does. Speaking from experience.

First off, Ive read FAR too many reviews stating this device doesnt answer you and other devices further away respond. theres a reason for this. You most likely had those set up as your ""main"" echo device and didnt bother to reset it to this ""new"" device. You have to assign the new echo as the main one. The device can hear you just fine, but you still have your previous device set as the speaker used to answer.Read the tutorials to best set up your device for multiple rooms because 9 out of 10 times youve missed a step.with that said this device soundS PHENOMENAL. Its no surround sound system and wont replace a stereo system (but could if you buy 2 echos plus a subwoofer and link them all into a right and left +sub audio stereo system!!) but it sounds better than any of the top of the line bluetooth devices I have. the bass is great, the mids are spot on and the trebles/highs are great. You can set them to your liking if youre not happy with any or prefer a different sound but in my opinion the sounds is fantastic.Ive had no issues with her recognizing my voice, I did however suffer the issue above (she would respond on my older speakers) but once i figured out how to reset up my rooms its all perfect now.I havent gotten a chance to use the zigbee hib only because i already have two other hubs set up and im too lazy to to restart everything under zigbee since its all working fine with my hue a gosund apps, maybe some day.Id recommend this over the dot or older echo any day of the week

We got it as a Christmas present to ourselves.  We got it during the Christmas sale for $59 which is a fantastic price for what you get.  We've never had one of these Alexa speakers before and we love it!  Sometimes she doesn't register our requests so we repeat ourselves and she usually gets it the 2nd time.  It is amazing what we can do with this.  Music and podcasts sound awesome!  Instant weather reports, news, just general questions, voice and routine light bulb control and she can even tell you the temp in the room (very cool).  I've written a few simple routines and she follows them without fail.  It is amazing the volume and fidelity of the speakers (two tweeters and one woofer) is amazing.  It sounds much larger than it is.  Would have given it 5 stars if would pick up the wake word the first time all the time.

I really like this product. I bought it for my husband who listens to a radio channel with low output as of now.  They broadcast online. So I bought him this as recommended by the DJ’s running the station. What a difference being able to pick this channel up on wifi!!  When my husband is not home I listen to Sirius XM and must say the channel is nice and clear on the Echo. I will be buying another Echo for my husband to listen to while he is in another room. Sound is clear, easy to use and it recognizes all voice commands.GOOD PRODUCT.

This device has pretty amazing sound for its size. It's far better sounding, than our Echo Dots, and that's for sure!The only problem is the poor voice recognition thing, but for some reason this has started happening on all our other echo devices, too.

. . . seems to have been wiped from the face of the Earth.I read the specs and thought ""why not"". So I was having problems with my Gen 2, had a conversation with Tech Support and they said that the Gen 4 was many steps ahead in many of the problem areas that I was having. SO, I traded it in (big mistake), Gen 2 and got a good price on the Gen 4. But it turned out to be the ""Alexa System"" itself and still is. I still have the same problems. If not more as things seem to be degrading. And the design of the Gen 4 doesn't help at all with salient interaction. But now I have them with the inadequacies of the Gen 4 Bowling Ball. (Whomever thought of that should be . . . )As with all the other features, they're over hyped. Including the ones that they are releasing as if it's the 12 Days of Christmas. I have too much Bass even though I have backed it off in the settings. The device rattles as if there is ""FUD"" in the speaker cavity and rattles every thing that is in the vicinity. It also distorts easily and there seems to be no common volume settings/volume leveling, I know there are settings, they don't work, across all systems that provide material. The volume seems to be doing it's own thing. I've seen this said in a couple places. Even the ""Adaptive Listening"" is the epitome of wonky. It seems to operate just the opposite for what they say. I get all my music and podcasts lower than ""She who shall not be named"" and when ""She"" chimes in, it's blaring! The ""Increased User Vocal Sensitivity Pickup"" is nothing like they profess or the Gen 2 was. I have found, so has my family, that I have yell to get it to hear me. And repeat myself a lot!! The way it's designed it has a ""Front"" that you have to be inline with or it doesn't work right. ""What happened to the guy that created this thing?!"" The Gen 2 responded to a normal talking level from 360°. ""She"" was just dumb. As they all are. The new ""Infra-Red Motion Sensing"" says that it's calibrated so that it reads things in a normal manner to avoid natural and not intentional movement. So it'll see a person when it's necessary and operate appropriately. ""So your don't have to wave your arms around in front of it"". YES YOU DO!AND with all this volume adjusting using the buttons on the top, HOW IN THE HECK DO YOU KEEP IT CLEAN?!!! I had though of putting it in a bowling ball cleaner at the lanes, but . . .There's so much just pain wrong with the whole situation in the first place that only make a half-arsed device, even more half-arseder. My Routines are no longer working completely. Sometimes they will completely fire off, to my surprise. But mostly not. Will fire off bit and pieces of a Routine if it cares. I'm having a heck of a time getting some devices to connect and once they are ""She"" snarfs them up and it's like having Double Natting in a Router. Other times I won't even be done and ""She"" says she sees it already and I haven't named it yet, so there's more work to make it right. And it doesn't always work.Oh! I have changed the voice over to the ""Male"" voice so I don't feel as bad cussing at it. But ""He's"" still dumb. Just like the ""pre-Demon"" Hemsworth in the ""Female"" version of ""GhostBusters"".Not sure what they are up to . . . I don't think they are either . . .

Same as before.I find I have to call her name 2 or 3 and sometimes even four times to get her to respond.

After using this for a few weeks there's definitely more negatives about this new model.  Compared to even the Gen 1 Echo Dot, its comprehension of what you're saying or ability to even hear you on the first try is not nearly as good.  Our old Echo Dot could hear us well from the other room, this one doesn't hear us on the first try 60% of time - from only a few feet way!  I've had enough experience with family members' earlier gen Echos to know this device is also inferior to them.The ball shaped, cloth coating gets dirty VERY quickly in a kitchen environment.****November 24, 2020****I purchased this Echo due to its ability to connect with Philips Hue bulbs without a hub.  The product is new enough that Amazon tech support does not understand that the Echo 4th generation does not work with Philips Hue bulb model LWB004. I have 2 of them and spent way too long on the phone trying to sort it out.  I ended returning my new Echo and getting again with a bundle of 2 new Hue bulbs (Model 453100).  Those Hue bulbs worked immediately and easily.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.  Definitely distortion on the maximum volume that is not there in older models.The size and shape are not as problematic as I thought it would be.  It does feel like it will be prone to getting damaged by kids more than the older coffee can version of the Echo design.In the end though, it is still cheaper than an Echo Dot plus a Philips Hue Hub.  And the Echo 4th gen certainly sounds better than an Echo Dot.  Additionally,  I am one of the people who got burned by Philips shutting off access to the first generation Hub, so I am happy to not be forced into buying another Hub from them.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.

I bought this to go with my Fire TV and my smartbulbs to get the start of a smart house, figuring I would go to more smart appliances if I was happy with it. And, at its core, its really cool to be able to control your lights or your tv with your voice. Alexa is good at recognizing voice commands, and the phone app that goes with is great at teaching you a bunch of things you can do with it.  I enjoyed experimenting with routines and other novelties. HOWEVER...The Echo doesn't work for more than a couple days at a time without needing a reset. Like, its not that big of a deal to go unplug it and plug it back it on occasion to get it to work again, but it kind of defeats the whole purpose. Nothing else we do can get it to start working again whenever it stops, not asking it to reconnect to the network, not trying to reset it from the app, nothing. At that point its sometimes quicker to just flip the light switch or grab the tv remote than go all the way to the Echo and wait for it to reset. I don't know what causes this problem. Maybe it loses connection to the wifi network randomly and doesn't have any protocol to automatically attempt to reconnect. Nothing else in the house has any issues with the network, so idk.If you just want it for the novelty, its fun to play around with. But if you're looking for a serious smart home assistant, maybe go for something a bit more reliable.

This is the first time ever having one of these types of gadgets. We've been very leery about getting one due to what we've heard on the news, etc. Who wants a listening device in the privacy of their home when hackers can hack into them. Not that I feel they are completely safe now but will trust that Amazon will continue to protect us the best they can. After watching a friend use a different brand, it was totally helpful while baking cookies over Christmas, having the gadget set timers galore by just speaking. That sold it for me. lol.So far I like all that I've done with it except the issue my partner has getting Alexa to listen. Setting timers with no response back is frustrating. Then you feel like you have to yell. Though I never have issues when I speak to her. Not sure why it has difficulties listening to one person but not another. I wondered in the beginning if she had hearing troubles if other noises were happening around her or nearby.Anyway I am still excited to try everything else out. Kind of wanna get the bulbs now and a security camera. lol.I purchased two of them and found we really only needed one. But Amazon is making be pay for shipping or I have to find a UPS store for it to be free to send back. I felt that was kind of unfair. We have drop off places that are convenient but not any actual stores. So I rather not lose money by having to pay to return. Who knows maybe having two will eventually come in handy. Was a good deal for two at the time anyhow.Thank you Amazon.

Before I purchased the new Echo 4th Gen I did a ton or research.  I have six echos in my house.  included in these isn are a  Echo 1t Gen and the Echo 2nd Gen, which were the two I was considering upgrading.  After reading all the Amazon reviews, I was concerned about three things that were usually noted in negative reviews.  1.  White power cord.  2.  Voice response.  3.  Sound quality with respect to comparing with the previous echos.  Now that I've had them, (I bought two), for a few days, I am prepared to respond to those comments.1.  White power Cord - Who cares?  It works and isn't an eye sore.  If it bothers you maybe you can take a Sharpie and color it black.2.  Voice response - A few reviews stated that the new Echo didn't respond as quickly and lacked a tad when music was playing.  I found this not be be true.  It responds as quickly as the previous echos, even with music playing.3.  Sound quality - These new echos promise better sound.  I found this to be true.  It definitely has better sound than the previous echos.  They are loud and the bass is quality.  I am very happy with the sound as this is the only way I listen to music in my house.So, overall, I am glad I bought two new echos.  They are awesome and the most important thing to me is the quality sound.  I am very satisfied and recommend anyone that is thinking of buying one, or upgrading an older echo, please do so.  You'll be very happy.

I have had different versions of Echo Alexa in one form or another for 5 years now. This one has the best sound by far from those I had before.That said it really does not hear me well sometimes and I am 1 foot from it. I have to say 'Alexa' slowly to get heard.

I've had a Gen 4 for a few weeks now. Other Echos I have are a 1st Gen Echo, a 1st gen Dot and a Show 5.I purchased the Gen 4 to replace my really early (pre-release/invite-ony) Gen 1 Echo. The Gen 1 still works fine and has been moved to another room. After a couple of hiccups setting up, the Gen 4 seems to be working fine. I had to reboot/reset it a couple of times to get the temperature sensor to calibrate, and I had to add/remove it from a group several times to get Guard to work.Pros: Obviously the addition of a Zigbee Hub is nice and the temperature sensor will be handy when I start upgrading my home thermostats to ""smart"" units. The Gen 4 seems to understand my commands more consistently and from greater distance. The audio quality is much improved over the Gen 1, even at low volume, especially the bass response.  Unfortunately, the bass gets a bit ""muddy"" at higher volume.Cons: I miss the volume twist-ring of the gen 1 and while the light ring at the bottom of the Gen 4  orb gives more of an ambient glow when activated, the top-mounted ring was more visible. The diameter of the orb is nearly twice the diameter of the cylinder, so it may affect placement for some people. Oh, and the power cord -- not only is it WHITE on a Charcoal colored device, but it is too short -- at least a foot shorter than the Gen 1 cord. (and they're not interchangeable.)Overall, I'm pleased with the new Echo, especially for the current (Dec 2020) sale price. It's worth the upgrade from an early Echo maybe not so much from an later one.

Upgrading from a 2nd Gen, the immediate changes are that this Echo is not a cylinder but a sphere, this Echo is no longer 360 degree project for sound, and this is already a stereo speaker.  No longer will I have to buy two of these for stereo sound.  The improvement in sound is absolutely outstanding with the price I paid being the same as with the older generation.  There is also major improvement to the subwoofer that allows for better bass when in use.  The sound edges the Echo Show 8 and is completely superior to the current generation Echo Show 5.  Against my older pair of Echo 2nd generations, this one speaker is an extreme improvement.  The microphone to pick up your voice is better at range than before, but since this is not a 360 speaker, you have to be within 110 degrees of the front and center for your voice to be recognized.  This is easily dealt with by proper placement.  I think this works best against a wall to force the acoustics to angle forward more.  This Echo certainly keeps up with voice commands, and using Zigbee is seamless.

The device just works great at every task it's made for. The sound,the integration to other devices and the Alexa functions all work seamlessly. It is probably way too intrusive into our daily lives and probably collecting information it shouldn't. Just turn off the microphones and hope they are complying. Other than the big brother factor it is a great device at a great price.

Beyond its aesthetic ugliness, it simply is impossible to set up. It doesn't work. The smart phone app is very difficult to follow in attempting to set up. After numerous attempts, this echo 4 simply sits on the shelf. I will probably return. Amazon customer service tech support is non existent. I have the echo 3 which works fine. This echo actually cannot handle the density of bits and bytes in a dense classical piece of music and audibly skips whole seconds of music because its small processor is weak. This is not an issue for the majority of buyers who listen to hip hop and the like. The echo 3 has no problem with this issue whatsoever. Amazon does not read or use these reviews, so it really doesn't matter, because amazon is so big, it could care less. I suspect that a it is rarely a good idea to buy electronics from amazon because most of it is knock offs and junk.Within 10 minutes of submit this review, I was stunned that an amazon tech employee called me out of the blue! I have to swallow my words now. This cheerful man helped me and within minutes the Echo 4 worked perfectly and was all set up!  Of course, Bezos (soon to be happily launched into space where he can stay) does give this kind of diligent employee, as well as others, the work conditions and th raises they need to make a living. I thank this man for his help. And, again, I take back everything, but for the skipping when there's too much music density such as an orchestra. It's true, Amazon doesn't always drop the ball. Thank you.

When I first got this the mic was kind of one the weak side, but has gotten a lot better over time. I have one Echo in my bathroom and two in my bedroom in a stereo combination along with two of the same generation Dots with clocks also paired in stereo configuration and in a sound group like they are in different rooms because you can't pair Dots and Echoes in. Still this combination has a great balance filling in parts missed by each other. I will be replacing the Dots soon and hopefully adding a subwoofer. The Dots will be moved to the kitchen along with the Show already there. For my purpose not being 360 is better because I actually get channel separation and I think it looks better on the stands I got. May post pictures later.

I never thought I would like Alexa. I would never buy it. Then both of my son put it in their house. So I bought one, then two. I now have four gen 4 echos, two echo dots, three gen 4 dots and other devices. Oh I also have an echo sub woofer.I can have my music anywhere in the house or selected rooms. I listen to book audible in the garage. I ask question Alexa answers most. She doesn’t answer dumb or politics.It turns my fans on or off according to temperature or sounds etc.Alexa makes lists. I make a grocery list, go to the store. While on my way to the store my wife adds items to the list. Once at the store I open the Alexa ap.

I own both the full size Echo 4th, and the Echo Dot 4th with LED Clock. I purchased two of the full size Echo 4th devices to allow for connectivity for Ring Bridge devices, notably a Ring Mailbox Sensor and a Ring Lighting Motion Sensor, both of which require either a Ring Bridge, or a Sidewalk Bridge device. This Echo device is specifically named as a recommendation. I gave it a shot, and both the mailbox sensor and the motion sensor went offline repeatedly, even when placed just a few inches from the Echo 4th Gen unit. Sometimes they came back online on their own. Sometimes they ran their batteries dead trying. I returned one of the sensors thinking I had a bad one and got the same results. When I bought a dedicated Ring Bridge, all the problems went away. Sidewalk Bridge simply isn't working and isn't reliable.As for the other features, the audio quality when listening to music or just hearing Alexa's voice is very boomy by default. I haven't tried playing with the equalizer, but really, I should be able to get decent quality from default settings.Voice recognition is hit-or-miss if you're not using Alexa as your wake word. It doesn't seem to matter much if you're facing the unit directly when you speak to it or if you're just somewhere in the room. Recognition is about the same either way, for better or worse.The unit itself is HUGE, and the audio is comparable to the Echo Dot 4th Gen, so if you're faced with a choice between the two and don't need Sidewalk, I'd recommend the Echo Dot.Lastly, the surface is covered with cloth, meaning that cleaning it isn't much of an option. I suspect that at some point, mine will look dingy enough from touching the buttons that I'll want to re-wrap it. Or maybe I should do that preemptively. Does anyone make custom skins for this thing?

 Great sound quality. The 2 speakers coupled with a subwoofer makes for a nice sound with a balance of bass and treble. The voice detection and interface is very good. The reactive bottom lighting is a great feature as well. Sort of reminds me of Kit from Knight Rider. Like you can tell it's thinking by the motion and color of the light.My only gripe is that you cannot access your YouTube music account. I'm positive this is because Google, whom owns YouTube, would rather you buy a Google smart device, so I switched to Amazon HD Music player. I'm new to the app so I'm still on the fence as to whether it's better or worse for music, although Amazon being HD music seems to have a little better quality. But YouTube has video, while Amazon does not. So if I have to get rid of YouTube Red I will miss being able to watch videos with no commercials. Unless I keep both, but all of these streaming services are starting to add up to a lot of bills.But overall, I'd say the Alexa device is one of the more attractive and high end sounding speakers available, especially when considering it was on sale for only $79. At that price, when it cones to sound quality, it's a little clearer sounding than my JBL Charge 2 $350 Bluetooth speaker. The Amazon doesn't get as loud as the JBL, but at mid and lower volume it sounds noticeably clearer.The AI, Alexa seems to give better and more detailed answers than my Google devices.

I love this speaker, coming from just a echo dot. The bass is crazy for such little speaker. It gets loud.the glass shelf I have it on will literally rattle anything on the glass off. Alexa is getting more and more smart with her updates and the such. It does take a couple trys at times to wake her but I would rather it be that way then too sensitive and just randomly turn on. I had bought this at best buy and it was on sale for 80 I wasn't even planning on buying a new alexa until I heard the sound quality and that it had a built in hub, which I am still learning but so far I have a philips hue bulb and she found it right away and it was so simple. I wasn't too fond of having a smart speaker and smart things but when your in bed at night and you just got comfortable she saves the day. Also using her to make phone calls is so much easier then using your phone just tell her who to call and she calls . That also goes for hanging up. Meanwhile use your phone for other things. I would recommend this. There is no question about how loud it gets or sound quality. The last thing I would say is if you don't think you need a hub or don't want one, this speaker is for you then because it already has one built in and zigbee is popular. It leaves that door open for so many devices. Watch one day you'll find a zigbee device and you'll remember that you have a built in hub.

Let me start off by saying I have been a LONG time user of the Echo platform, since gen one and have been a proponent of the platform. I have 20+ echo's and even upgraded some of them as time passes so maybe gone through 30. I just ran across an issue that had apparently popped up sometime last summer but just happened to us as well. I have bought all the Echo's in our family and registered them under my name, pretty standard. Up until we switched phones 3 weeks ago, my wife, who is in my household account, was ALWAYS able to go into her Alexa app and set alarms and reminders on any of our Echo's. As of yesterday that no longer is the case. She can only set alarms or reminders for her phone.I spent 2+ hours texting with 5 people in tech support, got so frustrated that I asked to be connected in person on a call. Talked to two more tech support people on the phone as well. They are telling(insisting) me that only the person who has the Echo registered to their name can set alarms or reminders on those Echo's. So if you have three kids with phones, they can no longer set alarms on any echo device. You can do it verbally still of course. But now if they want an alarm/reminder set in their room they have to walk up the stairs and verbally set it. How does this make ANY sense that only one person in a household can access the alarm/reminders on their mobile devices!?! Takes away half of our functionality!The funny thing is, every one of those techs said that is how it is supposed to work, even though for the last 4+ years my wife has been able to set her own alarms and reminders for our kids. THIS TAKES AWAY HALF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ECHO'S(if you have a family). That is how she set our kids alarms all through COVID. After a quick google search I found several AMAZON FORUM posts going back a year that this has been happening to other people as well. Just google 'Unable to view or set alarms on Household devices' and you can read for yourself. I screenshotted them as I suspect they will somehow disappear.I think something might be changing at Amazon with the Echo platform and they are slowly taking away this functionality as peoples accounts change or something. I can't make rhyme or reason of it that more people haven't brought this up though. But based on the silly Amazon rep responses and the consistent denial that this was a viable function from multiple Amazon tech's, Amazon appears to have no reason to try and fix this. I suspect they may be rolling out some sort of paid service for Echo's soon. How much money did Bezos lose until Amazon became ubiquitous with everyone was ordering online? He did just recently run up in the annual fee, etc.  Get them a taste or two for free then get them hooked. He is playing the long game for sure. Just my conspiracy theory.Anyways, I will definitely be sending back the other Echo's and thermostats I just bought and may look at switching over to google's devices. Thankfully all my home switches are compatible. Just beware, Echo is no longer nearly as useful for families(or households) anymore and you may want to avoid.

Integration was super easy and you won’t regret this upgrade. It easily paired with other Echo devices and if you tell Alexa to play music everywhere your home is filled with a pretty nice sound. For those ‘of a certain age’ …..remember when some homes had intercom systems with music in the entire house? Reminds me of that but way better sound haha. Buy it. It’s worth the upgrade.

 I just purchased my Second fourth generation echo speaker it was easy to set up in the app as a home theater the sound that comes out of my Sony TV now is just like a home theater it’s excellent it’s crisp it fills the room it’s just awesome I highly recommend getting two speakers if you have a television that just has the regular TV speakers you can’t go wrong on the price is always right I got my second speaker on prime day so it was $30 off regular price of 99 hope you enjoyed this review😉

The really negative reviews kind of baffle me. There is no question that this is an upgrade from the prior version.I think the sound quality is great. Have you gone in to the Alexa app and individually adjusted the audio settings for the device? You can adjust the bass, treble, and mid range within the app, similar to how you would do so on your car radio; I’m wondering if those that have commented so negatively about the sound quality knew or did that.Admittedly, I thought the sound was too bass heavy at first. Went in to the settings, and naturally each of the three audio settings were at zero, so I bumped the mid range and treble all most all the way up, and the bass just one more mark. Really evened out the sound, and I got to dancing quicklike. I take that as a good omen though that I thought it was bass heavy when the setting was on zero (it was just that the treble and midrange were too).  Seems to speak the quality of the small sub in there.  And I haven’t noticed much difference, if any yet regarding the direct sound vs prior 360 sound. Pretty room filling still. I’m looking forward to testing it out with the fire cube eventually.Setup was seemless, even rearranging three other, older devices and getting “play everywhere” set back up.  The new echo had no problem reconnecting with my various smart devices, maybe took a couple of minutes at most.So, yeah, so far, nothing but good things to say. Will update if that opinion changes.

In our house we have four previous generation echo dot and we wanted to try an echo mostly for playing music with more quality sound.We were pleasantly surprised because this one is way more responsive than the ones we previously have and the sound quality is pretty good.So it is really an upgrade.

I bought this Alexa ball after realizing the marketing kings already know everything about me anyway, so might as well have this listening in. My phone, TV, and I think it must be my rug or something, already knows even what I'm thinking about.Anyway, I was hoping it could change my TV channels at least, but that involved buying another gizmo. OH --""PREMIUM SOUND"". Not sure what that means but it isn't hifi Bose quality. More like enhance AM radio.That voice ... annoying, so I changed it. It says you can change the voice, but its only male of female. And they say you can change the wake up name. There are only a couple that you can choose from a list as well. All with multiple syllables, and I want a one syllable name..like JOE... Hey Joe. So it stays Alexa with a male voice.I love the shape and look, and with the added light at the base, it looks pretty cool. It would be even better if the entire globe radiated soft pastel colors and then jumped bright red when someone is detected at the front video doorbell You could keep the yellow for when a package is delivered by Amazon.THe jokes are pretty corny. The weather report is great, and it can tell you what temperature is residing at its location. Overall use for TV is great if you have a Fire TV. It wants to go to Fire TV over ROKU or even cable. Changing cable using the Fire TV Blaster is a bit hit or miss. It doesn't respond the same to even the same command to change the channel. Overall using Alexa to control the TV is hit or miss anyway. Much easier to just use the remote.My overall assessment is that it's a cool gimmick, not really practical. That might be me though, as I'm old. A longtime tech-head, but an old one. Sometimes cool factor of a product isn't worth the bother.

I bought this echo to replace an echo dot and get better sound.  I was a little surprised when I opened the box and saw how big it is in comparison with my echo dot.  When I started it up and played music it was an awesome full, rich sound with good bass tones.  I really love it!

We've been early adopters of Amazon Echo devices - have half a dozen between home and work, from the first edition, to the ""dot"" to the Echo-plus w/ subwoofer.  The 4th generation is a big disappointment; the placement of the microphone in the bottom (rather than the top as in earlier generations) makes it much less sensitive to voice command.  Frequently an older ECHO in a more distant room will respond to a command made directly to the 4th generation (while standing right in front of it.). Tried placing on a tripod (to raise the microphone) but no improvement.  For the best deal, the ""dot"" is best.  For best sound, the first or second generation is good (even bought a refurbished one which works great).  The Echo-plus w/ subwoofer is best for overall sound, but again, less sensitive to voice commands.  Sometimes with the Echo 4th generation, I honestly just miss the radio.  Or streaming thru my computer.  Terrible device.Follow up-got a call from Amazon and used the command button on top (round circle w/ circle inside) to reset the ""awake"" command.  Apparently some of these had sensitivity problems from the factory - but pushing the command/reset button for just a second allows the device to download an improved voice recognition system.  Much better now, so have revised up to 4 stars.  Put the device in our shop and walked outside to give awake command - worked fine.  Much more sensitive, and seems to have solved the problem completely.  Great sound too.

I never considered I'd purchase or become a fan of Amazon Echo. Despite my prior reservations, I'm truly a fan now! The convenience. The integration with the Alexa app, Kindle books, Amazon Music and Audible to name a few is just the beginning of my happy start. The sound is unexpected and amazing for such a small device. The fact that I also have Echo Dots for other locations in home just makes it even more convenient and I'm looking forward to finding more ways to make my life easier.

The sound is top notch.  The only difficulty I experienced with this is pairing with a device via bluetooth.  It was inconsistent for a bit, but resetting then repairing my device resolved my issue.Adding the right Alexa skills to it, makes it a great device to use for a multitude of tasks.It would be nice if it had a screen but, interacting and configuring the Echo via the Alexa app is a pretty good option too.If you have privacy concerns, you can toggle the microphone off and Alexa won't listen to you for request or anything.  You could still utilize the Alexa app (via an alternative device like a phone) to command your Echo to do things still.

This is my first Alexa and I have to say I am very impressed with how the device works and talks. The only thing that upsets me is how she isn’t very well integrated with Apple Music. She can play public playlists that Apple produces and such but she can’t play your own personal playlists. One other thing that disappoints me is that she can connect to a wide variety of Bluetooth speakers except for LG speakers. When setting up speakers it gives you options for tons of name brand companies but LG isn’t there. Fret not because there is an option to set up a Bluetooth speaker not specified(such as Lg) but when trying to connect to Bluetooth Alexa couldn’t seem to find my speaker even when set to Bluetooth mode. She found other things such as printers and such. I will try manually plugging my Alexa into my speaker but the point of using Bluetooth is so the speaker and Alexa are in different parts of the room/house. Other than those two minor things Alexa is a very fun device and incredibly useful as well. When looking through reviews I notice a fair amount of people complain about audio quality compared to other alexas and I have to say that I have worked a fair share in the audio business and when listening to my friends gen 3 Alexa play music compared to the gen 4 is totally different. The gen 4 completely blows the gen 3 out of the water. It just sounds more full and crisp. And if you’re a stickler for certain sound adjusts then simply ask Alexa for more bass of treble and whatnot.

We purchased a 4th Gen Echo speaker to replace our 1st Gen Echo speaker.  To my ear the sound of the 4th Gen is not as bright as the 1st Gen until you boost both the treble and midrange using the Alexa equalizer.  Other than that it is a fine product that integrates well with the other Alexa devices and smart home products that we use.

It definitely has better sound that my old echo 3rd generation.  It does not compare with my Bose Home 500 but, of course, the price is much lower than the Bose.What I definitely hate is the color of the cable.  Was it too much to ask for a cable that matches the product?Another dislike, although not a big deal, is the spherical shape, it it is just weird. I could easily move my Echo 2dn gen with one hand, but not this one.

It all started when I got the first echo plus. Couldn't believe how rich the sound was. Last year I bought the 4th generation echo with premium sound.  Paired it with the first echo plus.

I was looking to upgrade from my Echo 2nd Gen. Particularly, an audio upgrade. The two options I was considering: an Echo Studio, or two Echo 4th Gens paired together with their stereo function.I ended up buying two Amazon Echo 4th Gens when they went on sale for Prime Day.They were easy enough to pair together. HOWEVER - the stereo function does not work when you are playing anything via a Bluetooth connection (or a hard cable connection, for that matter).The Echo stereo function apparently over works when playing stuff over WiFi. I would say this sounded quite wonderful; a really impressive audio setup. If you play music or podcasts via Amazon music (or another platform that plays via WiFi accessible through Alexa), I'd say this is a worthwhile audio system.The problem - when I played audio (both music and podcasts) from my iPhone via Bluetooth, the audio would come from only one speaker. Hence, no stereo. My personal audio world runs almost exclusively through my iPhone, so this was obviously an issue for me.So is just one speaker worth it? I'd say the audio from one Echo 4th Gen is definitely an improvement over the 2nd Gen Echo I have. Whether it's a worthwhile upgrade is up to your individual ear. For my part, I had my heart set on a substantially improved audio system, so I returned the 4th Gen and will hold out for the Echo Studio. (Now I just have to wait for it to go on sale).

I love the Alexa Echo. It's my first Alexa product.  I love being able to interrupt a song to ask who's singing it and it will go back to playing the song without skipping a beat.  I love how easy it is to ask Alexa to do something.  I love that she says, ""You're welcome."" in different ways if I say, ""Thank you.""  That was a surprise.  I love just naming an artist and she'll play a shuffle filled with that artist's music and that she'll play one song over and over again in a loop if I'd like that.  All in all, I've been having a ball learning how to use the Echo.  I know there's so much more that it can do!

 Amazing new sound! I tested echo out by playing music by the band “Deep Forest” which, in order to appreciate MUST BE played on a quality speaker and echo knocked it out the park! The sound is incredible! I love it. I have so much more to explore but the sound quality alone blew me away and I can’t turn it off! And, at a fraction of the cost comparatively to competing speakers! I shared a sample as part of my review. I hope it does the echo justice!However,  I don’t like the white power cord either. It gives the impression of a mismatch (white cord, black unit…weird!).After 3 days I’m beginning to notice small problems. For example, when I stop music, there is a “crack” sound, as if someone pulled the plug on the speaker, rather than a clean power down. Also, I’ve had to find a spot not too high and not too low so she hears me. Which was annoying because I had to get out of bed to adjust her height, while I was lying in bed, then again the next day when I was moving about. I think I found a happy medium. But again it was annoying.Oh, and if you’re the nervous about your info type person, Echo might not be for you! She required permissions to anything and everything in order for you to take full advantage of the fun and benefits of using this smart speaker.Should I discover any more pros or cons that I think might be helpful, I’ll add here.

I have owned every echo since their inception . And one fact is true ... amazon has done a very good job with making small improvements while keeping the costs down . This latest design is once again a minor improvement on the previous generations I own . The sound has improved a bit . Slightly more bass and treble . Still not a Sonos or a Bose ... but the cost isn’t either . So it’s a compromise . Glad they finally just included the “hub” instead of 2 separate models . The design being a sphere is up for debate . One thing that isn’t ... it’s no longer a omnidirectional speaker . It sends sound where you point it . So unfortunately you can’t bounce the sound off a wall to increase the bass like previous generations  . The look ? Meh ... kinda weird . But not a deal breaker . One complaint I have as well as others : the led indicator that lets you know it’s listening is now on the bottom . Terrible placement . You just can’t ever see it ! If it was higher or if it was much brighter perhaps . 2 things that I’m not happy about at all  : 1) like others have said ... the microphones are no longer as sensitive as other generations . My older echos almost never miss when I ask a question , even clear across the house . This one ? I very often end up screaming at it , especially when the music is playing . Even when I’m just a few feet away. It seems as though there are either less microphones or the ones on this model are not as discerning. Perhaps a software update in the future will improve this . ( note : I am not alone in my evaluation - others are having the same issue) 2)  My biggest dislike ? I purchased 2 black / charcoal echos ... and they give you white power cords with white power blocks ! White ? Seriously ? No doubt this is a cost saving measure so that they include the white ones across the board no matter what you order . But ... they are ugly as Hell ! They do not blend in at all . Hopefully they listen to all of us complaining and change this - as well as swap out our white ones for black ones . Amazon pulled a Henry Ford with the model T . You can have any color you want ... as long as it’s Black ! One last thing - terrible WiFi reception !

I have an echo dot, fire tv cube and a new echo. The microphone on the echo seems less responsive than the old echo dot I have. I can be sitting in the living room, where I have the echo, and when I say, hey Alexa, it doesn’t light up. Often, I can try to play a song in the living room and the echo dot in my bathroom will start playing. Even the fire tv cube in my bedroom responds better than the echo. I even changed the wake words for the devices in case that was the issue, however it may have helped the echo only slightly. The dot still responds from two rooms away, yet the echo doesn’t always respond from ten feet away. Otherwise it is a good device. The sound is much better than the dot. There is distortion if I turn it too loud but even turning it down a little clears it up, and is still plenty loud to jam out while cleaning. 😊

This Alexa worked ok for about 10 months, now a year later it’s either dead some days or dying, it will not pair with our echo dot that is literally 11 ft away and as of a few months ago (a week after the return date expires) we get the response to a request “I’m sorry I didn’t get that” every other day.  It has started making a very loud static noise which interrupts whatever it is the thing is trying to rate.  I have rebooted our internet and the device multiple times to no avail.

Echo 4 Gen is simply the best overall. There is no sense in trying to save $30 (or whatever) be it your first or add-on. Mic comes in 2nd to the Hockey Puck Echo Dot Gen 3 (the 3rd gen clearly surpasses all other Amazon assists) with better-louder und less muffled audio (tho I have no issue with the echo dot 3rd gen either)Summary: Simply their best device und with Zig, so there you have it. Not a fan of the echo show line ... poor mics and overall pointless. The Echo Show 5 is a great alarm clock - well worth it for that; as anything more ... nah. But again .... truly a cool clock (or would be if Amazon would ever fix the fading and random 'Alexa thinks you should know' trivia that persists even with every-bit of display options disabled

I’m an Apple person and I’ve been one my whole life, but I’ve been waiting for the last 10 years for Apple to get their smart home game together and they haven’t done it. I have a whole bunch of smart devices that were really cumbersome to use because they didn’t support HomeKit or they had crappy apps. I didn’t realize that Alexa would do such a great job of unifying all of my smart home devices, and I underestimated the true convenience of being able to do things like:1. Turn on the TV or change the TV input without having to find the remote.2. Adjust the light brightness, turn the lights on and off, or set a mood lighting scene.3. Tell my Roomba to start cleaning4. Turn my Dyson fan on, off, or to a specific setting without fumbling for a remote.5. Set routines that automatically adjust the settings and power devices on and off at specific times of the day.6. Have a smart assistant that’s actually smart and can give me real information were perform legitimately helpful tasks.7. Find my Tile keys using my voice8. Turn my smart plug devices on and offIn many ways I’ve overestimated Siri’s “smartness”. I still love my iPhone, but as a personal assistant and smart home hub it is trash.The only thing I don’t like about my echo is the fact that the bass is a little bit too intense. It does have settings to go in and adjust on the app which I did but it’s still seems like they went to far.

Much better than my old echo device. Deep and rich. Makes me wonder if they intentionally reduce sound quality in older devices to get you to upgrade lol. Anyways, I’m happy with it.

The unit works much better than I thought it would. It can hear me around the corner of a hall about 20ft.  I have it for just turning on lights that are difficult to find the knob for and then get to come on.  I thought about this to help my 94 year old mother who has macular degeneration in her eyes.  It is much better than I even dreamed it will call someone by voice so she doesn't have to fool with her phone.  It is just great! Answers questions, plays music, searches the web.  Naturally it is ready to take any Amazon order.  I haven't found all the tricks it can do yet but really I am impressed.  It helps me sleep by playing Ocean sea side sounds or rain storm noises.  Draws my mind away from my busy thoughts. I bought 2 Echos and three bedroom Echo.Dot 4th. I could get the Echo to turn on the lights in my room at the top of my open stairs but with the Echo. dot in my room I can control the lights from my bed.

Like the new look and better sound. Was very disappointed that I am required to connect all Zigbee devices one by one and that there is no way to edit all devices simultaneously. In the settings for each device it lists how the device is connected to Alexa. Would like to be able to just change it to the new Zigbee hub but it is not configurable. A long drawn out process to update to next generation Alexa.

Bigger than 3rd gen echo, but good sound quality.  Connected easily to my Alexa network.  BUT, I cannot understand why they paired a black echo with a white power cord.  Was this a mistake, because it looks as if I am using the wrong cord.  Cannot use power cords for previous versions of Alexa/Echos.  Small, but extremely irritating issue.

My Bluetooth speaker died so I replaced my old Alexa with a new one as it was less expensive than buying a new Bluetooth speaker with Dolby sound. The setup is just like other Alexa devices but this unit did not connect correctly for the first 24-48 hours. I don’t know if it was just a temporary glitch but after a few days, it was fine. Alexa CS tried to help but couldn’t ID the problem. We have many Alexa units and never had the same problem.

I really like this product . It’s luxurious and can connect to my Nest (home Air unit) , t.v and stove . My son really helps me with Alexa . The only small complaint is that she likes my sons and hubby’s voices and listens to them more . Maybe my voice isn’t high enough . Overall I love it !

This is a nice wifi connected speaker. I love the design and aesthetics updates of the product shape, size, and button placement.  I actually prefer the sound profile of my original Gen 1 echo though, the tall cylinder one, even though this new design has much better bass quality, maybe I have more of a vocal preference. I have mine sitting on a granite countertop in the bathroom for shower listening (volume 8 or 9) and I've noticed it moves due to strong vibrations during music playback so that's a bit annoying; room placement and hard surface surroundings may take part here.  Alexa integration and response does seem much better with this new generation with better voice pickup and quicker response (not so much yelling on my part).  I also wish the power cord it came with matched the speaker, black in my case, it came with a white one that stands out unfortunately. I really enjoy being able to connect/sync play all of my echo devices (Gen 1, Dot, and this new one) in an ""everywhere"" group throughout the house, and there's definite audio profile differences between them. Overall a great speaker and Alexa response agent, just some personal preference issues, would recommend buying for sure, I got mine on a 20 dollar off sale for 70, and I would probably rank it more in the $50-60 worth range.

I’m a longtime Echo user and have owned each generation since the first. While I use my Echo for many reasons, I’m an avid music lover and I use it a lot for listening to music. After reading various glowing reviews on its sound quality, I decided to purchase the 4th generation Echo. I must say that I’m not impressed by the sound at all, it was a bit disappointing. And I actually prefer the sound quality of my 3rd generation over this one. If you’re not purchasing it for music, you’ll be happy with the integration of Alexa for various smart home apps and devices. Bottom line… When it comes to setting it apart from other smart speakers in the category of sound, I sincerely hope Amazon does more to wow music-loving customers like me.

After reading the reviews I was somewhat a sceptic.  I was reading things from the audio quality isn’t that great, people liked previous versions more then this one and so on.My first impression was, “oh it’s only that big?”  Without giving it much credit before turning it on.When I played music for the first time, I was thoroughly impressed with it impressive bass where the kids/highs are somewhat muddy but not horrible.  The intent was to have something in my office for ambient music while working along with having ambient sounds play for my cat.  It’s a win win and think I’m going to enjoy having this in my space.

I love that when I'm not home and my dog barks Alexia will give him instructions and play music to calm him. Then she will send me messages he was barking. I love being able to tell her good morning and she tells me the weather and a day in history fact. It so convenient to ask her to set reminders for my husband so he take medicine when needed. Or any reminder you may need! My daughter loves that she remembers what songs she likes and dailey Alexa tells her an encouraging quote. Overall Alexa is a great addition to our family! I would recommend to anyone

She works as intended. Only beef I have is that you can't manipulate the quality of sound. I have tinnitus, so I need to increase the treble to hear past the constant ringing. So far there are no qol adjustments I can make. Otherwise, she's very helpful. And works well on starlink 👍

We’ve had the first generation dot for ages. The sound was adequate but left a lot to be desired for music. It also seemed to need a little louder voice to trigger responses.

The 4th Gen Echo (I have the full size one) is really great. This is my first Echo I own, but I've seen 3rd Gen one on some of my friend's house and they were so excited to use it so I thought I'll give a try too (after an extensive research, as I was looking also at its direct competitor's offer, but now I'm really glad I've chosen Alexa).What is nice about 4th Gen is that it has a Zigbee hub (which was available previously on Echo Plus) and a temperature sensor built in, so I can always ask Alexa what is the current temperature in my room, which is great. I also have 2 Zigbee light bulbs paired directly with it in 2 separate rooms that could be easily controlled by voice or with Alexa app. Lately, I also bought an Aeotec Smart Things hub which Alexa handles nicely through SmartThings skill.Regarding the sound, I think it's great, the mids are crisp and the bass is rich and well contoured. I like very much that I can say ""Alexa, connect to my phone"" or my PC and I can play music on it within seconds via Bluetooth.I really like that Alexa is so smart and continuously learning from my voice and commands, and also I like that it recognizes my family members when they talk to it (my small daughter likes to ask how a particular animal sounds).I think Echo is a real benefit for elderly people or disabled ones, because so many things/commands can be done only by voice.In conclusion, I really love Echo 4th Gen, which has fast become a family companion. I fully recommend it!!

This is my first Echo that is not a Dot and it sounds wonderful. I had one of my 4th generation Dots hooked up to an external speaker via Bluetooth (the one I am replacing), but I found out rather quickly that there was no need for an external speaker with the 4th Generation Echo. Bass was excellent (and can be changed with a built-in equalizer using the Alexa app), as were the high and lows. I hear and read by a lot of people that This Echo is not omni-directional when it comes to voice commands, but if you are placing it near a wall (mine is placed on top of my computer desk and the back of the Echo is facing a wall), there is no need for that. Very satisfied with my purchase and I got it for a great price. Very solidly built and much heavier that the Dot. From now on, all my purchases will be for the latest Echo and not a Dot (I have one in every room in my apartment).

An Amazon tech suggested this would solve all the inconsistencies we had been having, but then two other Amazon employees (one tech, one from CS) talked me out of it, the former suggesting that the Show 8 would be better because it was more recent. BAAAAP!! Wrong.  Why?  This is a Home Base, the others are all satellites.  I added a Wyze switch after adding this and sure enough, Alexa already had it and its name/location.  Before getting this it What is been far more complicated to get it to see it at all, and be prone intermittent contacts.Unlike all the other Alexa products we have gotten, as soon as I plugged it in, it knew the login already and began setting itself up!Not sure why this isn't a clearly stated fact, but the Echo v4 is the key to the system working properly.  Not any Echo Dot or Show. This, the Home Base.

Aside from the ""by the ways"" that force me to wait, here's my experience with Alexa this afternoon.I set 2 timers for a nap. After they rang, I set another 30-minute timer (I know I nap quite a bit). However, after the new timer is set, the old timer kept ringing. So I said to Alexa with my dreamy eyes, ""Alexa, turn off the alarm"" to which Alexa replied, ""there is no active alarm.""Thinking that the 30-minute timer is canceled too, I told Alexa again, ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" It replied, ""Second alarm set for 30 minutes."" Frustrated, I then told Alexa to clear all timers and set just 1 alarm for 30 minutes, to which it replied, ""Third alarm set for 30 minutes.""Not wanting three alarms to go off one after another, I asked Alexa to clear all timers. Alexa then read to me, that I have 3 active timers set, with the FIRST timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, the SECOND timer set to 30 minutes X minutes X seconds remaining, the THIRD timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, which one did I want to cancel. I said ""all of them."" Alexa then said ""timer all of them"" was not found and then hung up on me. I then had to tell it to cancel my timers again. It repeated the same information about each of the timers, which took a very long minute, and then proceeded to ask me which timer I wanted to cancel again. ""You have a 30-minute timer with 23 minutes and 40 seconds left, a 30-minute timer with 25 minutes and 12 seconds left, and a 30-minute timer with 26 minutes and 23 seconds left. Which timer would you like to cancel?""""The 30-minute timer."" I replied.""Fourth timer, 30 minutes, starting now.""----------------------------------------------------------------Although I have now figured out that I needed to say to Alexa ""clear all timers,"" frustrations like these and all the unwanted advertising are still making me want to just donate Alexa to charity. Maybe I will someday.

The Echo was easy to set up and the sound quality is *much* better than my 1st-Gen Echo, but the sound is still a bit ... tinny? ... to my ears - which has been the case with any BT speaker that I've had in this size (though it's better than any of those).

These speakers when paired with a tv using 4K firestick can only access up to volume 10. Speaker has 20 volume levels. We have a large living room so we purchased two speakers.

I'm new to Alexa (never saw the need) and your basic elderly techno-nerd.  I LOVE this!!!  The set up instructions were easy enough to follow (but not entirely simple).  The sound is great!!💖  Pretty much all I'm interested in is listening to music, and in all my 70 years of using all the formats that come along this is the BEST!!!  You just tell it to play whatever you want to hear....and it does 🤭  There's not enough words for me to recommend that EVERYBODY get one of these!  (Another handy feature is when you're standing in front of an empty refrigerator you can speak the items you want and she adds it to shopping list that gets sent to your phone 🤯😲 )  I'm sure as time goes on I'll figure out much more.

The 4th Gen speakers work great to have one in the kitchen, living, and master bedroom.  All speakers work perfectly individually and when I have them in a group so I can hear the same music in each room.  Best investment ever.  I also have the echo dot and works great with the group.

I upgraded to this echo from my first generation echo thar has served me well for many years. The ultrasound capabilities will be something I will be experimenting with to automate some actions. The suggested actions gave me a few ideas to try.

The style is kind of cool, with the sphere thing.  I find the sound to be very satisfying and full ranged.  Plus you can adjust the 3-band EQ (bass, midrange, treble) to your taste in the app.  The bass quality is quite good, but when you get to a party-time level, the speakers will pop, even with the bass set to center.  But even worse is any kind of hip-hop or anything with a deep bass beat -- they will it make it pop (crackle/distort,) even at fairly low volumes.  Also I have found Alexa to misunderstand me a few times, even though I was close to the Echo and speaking very clearly.  The number ""nine"" must be pronounced long and clear or you'll get ""that was incorrect"" (if you're playing a trivia game, for example.Overall, I like the Echo a lot, and enjoy it's rich sound.  Despite a few flaws, it performs well and is a great addition to any room.

This works great when connected to the internet but is a paperweight without a connection, which should not be the case for such a device. The setup is more complicated than it needs to be!

Wanted an Alexa that could double for an actual speaker and got 3 different ones.

The voice recognition doesn’t work well if the speaker is at max volume but that makes sense. 5/5!

I like it becuase:1. Echo 4th gen is easy to set up. Responds almost immediately after you plug in.2. Sound quality is superb.  Clear highs, clean mid-range and a deep bass that you can adjust using the app.3. I purchased 2 chargeable batterys so I can take anywhere where no outlets are.  Battery has decent longevity 4-5 hours.4. Compact and the round shape gives it personality and not bulky. Comes in different colors.I don't like because:1. I have 5 echos in different rooms.  Sometimes when you ask Alexa to play music in the ""everywhere  mode"" Not all the echos respond....some are on and some off.  I called help and they advised me to reverse the plug. After that all the echos responded but its doing it again.2. Sometimes Alexa does not respond to my voice command which is frustrating.3. Sometimes Alexa voice is tinny and not the full normal volume that she usually responds with and the music is tinny and not full either. I have to try and unplug and try to see if that fixes the problem....it's hit and miss which irritates me.I just purchased from Amazon so they are new echos.  I've been testing them out and this is what is happening.  I love the sound they put out and having Alexa respond when she's not moody is fun and satisfying.Would I recommend the 4th gen echo of course but these bugs gotta stop or demand for it will lessen as time goes bye.

Bought during prime day a month ago, one day Alexa started rattling and warbling like Katherine Hepburn in 'On Golden Pond'. Speaker obviously blown, but never played music loudly. Amazon customer service is OK, but I'm waiting a week-two weeks for a replacement? I should've been sent a replacement first (I had to box up the broken one and ship it back to them at a UPS store) and when the replacement arrived, put the defective one in the same box and send it back. I've been an Amazon Customer for more than 20 years (back to when they only sold primarily books, remember?)

TLDR: Disgraceful. Don’t buy.For reference and comparison:I own: 2 original echo dots, 2 second gen full Echo’s, 3 second gen echo dots. Every single one of those outperforms this “newer” spherical echo.Horrible microphone. Horrible.I have 1st echo dots picking up what I’m asking for in the next room over instead of this device with the “latest and greatest technology”.Sound quality?Seriously buy a latest (non-spherical) echo dot.Superior in every single possible way you can think of.You probably won’t read this review or think it’s legit but I took the time to write this all out to warn you and hopefully save you from wasting money on this device.Oh, almost forgot, it ships with a white power cable.I mean, come on, why??Seriously, power chord is probably better performing than the echo itself.In a word: Disgraceful.

I haven't used the device long enough to give a full review. but overall, I am satisfied because it performs all the primary features that I expected. This was a big improvement for my smart home setup. I have smart light bulbs, switches, IR-remotes, and door sensors. They all work fine with Alexa.Positive:- Great sound quality- Integration with most smart systems- Drop-in & Alexa announcement features are great for in-house intercom- Customization flexibility by creating routines- Zigbee hubNegative:- Linking services could be unstable sometimes. Smart-life devices got unresponsive once but it was easily fixed. Spotify music does not always behave as expected but it works fine for the most part.- Running routines by saying a custom word does not always work. Sometimes Alexa would go to Wikipedia and read something instead of running an action. My workaround was to use 3-4 words to run the action but I would have been better if I had the option to give priority to my routines over Alexa going to the internet to fetch something.

I upgraded from a 2nd gen that I loved... Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me.  I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it.  The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible.  Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker.  I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me.  I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed.  Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me.  I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work.  There is definitely a flaw in the design or components.  Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues.  I am ready to throw this in the trash.***UPDATE: 10/5/22***Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me.  I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review.  They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones.  Why the reduction in microphones?  With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response,  and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond.  It is actually comical at this point.  I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond.  Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones.  I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing.  Huge disappointment for a great device.We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations.  By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time.  I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years.  2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio.  I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.

This seems like it would be a useful, hands-free device, but so far we're not impressed. The AI seems weak and always interested in sending us to some subscription site. The weight of the plug causes the plug to fall out of the wall socket. I assume it's Alexa trying to avoid having to deal with us :) The speaker quality is decent, but not really outstanding. It can get loud, but the bass is dull IMHO and muffles clarity at times.Anyway, if you like shouting commands at someone repeatedly (maybe you're a drill sergeant or unhappily married), then this might be a diverting toy for you. More seriously, though, if you have restricted mobility or you live alone, then this device could be a real time/effort saver if you have it hooked up to other devices in your home (e.g., lights, tv, wall thermometer). You should be aware that there is a trade off between your privacy and the detail of your personal experience. For example, Alexa will want access to your contacts if you use it for calling folks via your wifi (your internet connection). And, it wasn't so long ago that people were able to hear others' conversations and command history. BTW: This is information you can look up via your Amazon account. So, travel with caution and ask yourself whether voice commands are superior to the discretion of silently typing your searches (which are archived is a cloud unless you disable the feature). I'll update this review once I've had more experience with the device, but right now, it seems that an Apple iPad does pretty much the same things (with Siri) and video availability (though at a much greater cost).

I was momentarily on the fence about paying $30 extra for improved sound. It was worth every penny. This (slightly larger) echo orb has excellent sound. Great for larger rooms in my home.

All I wanted was a way to play music.  Alexa has a decent speaket for my purposes and I figure it will work well with my Prime Music.  Ha.  I've never been able to get Alexa (or Echo) to reliably play a playlist without a big hassle.  I took to setting up routines to get the device to play the right playlist.  But now it won't even do that.  Now Alexa will play my playlist - the same one it's played for 3 months - on ""shuffle and similar song"" mode.  I mean, if I wanted random music I'd ask for that and not ask for a playlist.  When I ask to turn off shuffle mode Alexa says it can't.  I checked my prime music and it is NOT on any kind of auto shuffle mode that I can see.  Going with Alexa for music has been a mistake. A device that is supposed to make life easier has been a constant source of frustration and now a complete fail for the purpose I bought it.  I can't imagine how frustrating it must be if you want to do anything more challenging than playing a music playlist.

I had reservations about Alexa and the home AI IOT trend.  Still have.  But I've found this to be a really fun and convenient device that works very well.  The user has very good control over its features so its not the privacy threat I imagined.  It can be more integrated with your phone and other devices that would allow it to cross that threshold, but these are all user options.  I use it mainly to connect to Amazon Music and it has really impressive in voice recognition.  Ask ""Alexa"" to play Beethoven's 7th symphony opus 92 and ""she"" does it immediately.  No delay.  Thus far I haven't found anything it won't play. It even works well if you give it commands in a normal tone of voice from another room.  If you don't like ""Alexa"" it has a couple of other key words you can use instead.  When its recording it turns on special indicator lights so you don't have to wonder.  Very impressed and its really cool.

Just set up my two Echo 4th Gens in Stereo in my office along with a Fire TV 4K attached to one of my 4K computer monitors. Replaced two Echo 3rd Gens. I used the power adaptors from the 3rd Gen to keep the 4th Gen looking nicer than with the included WHITE power adaptor (both are 30 watts)! Using the white ones with the demoted 3rd gen in another bedroom. Have the Echo Studios in my bedroom with a 4K TV and the Fire TV 4K as well. Of course, I have a 7.2.1 System in my bedroom as well.When eq'd to lift treble and bass a bit, the 4th Gen sound almost as good as Sonos 1's that are next to the 4th Gens. I am addicted to speakers and headphones for those who care. One thing that I noticed with both the 3rd and 4th Gen is that when used with a Fire TV and paired, they have very nice soundstage and imaging is beautiful. I have mine five feet from me on either side and the combined imaging is directly in front of my 4K Monitor in front of me. Very nice! While they are not HiFi speakers by any means, they are nice and well worth the $170 I paid per pair of them. My Sonos sound a bit better, but I enjoy the TV sound for my office and controlling Tidal, Deezer, and Amazon HD content with my Fire TV remote more than using Sonos, Google Home, and/or Alexa to control the Sonos speakers.

I got the echo to use a speaker for my fire stick to stream tv and movies. However, when paired wirelessly the sound was not very good. It sounded like the speaker had a bunch of reverb or something. I tried a bunch of different fixes with the amazon customer service people but nothing worked, so I got a replacement echo but the sound was the same. However, when I connected the speaker to the Fire Stick with an aux cable, the sound was much improved. It is just annoying that I had to do that.So if you were thinking using the Echo as a wireless speaker to stream shows and movies, I would caution against it.

This is the best Echo so far. The sound is great and despite what others say this thing responds even while I have music all the way up on all four of my Echo’s at once. I bought one during Prime Deals Days. It arrived within hours. I was so impressed I bought another one that day.

Overall, speakers with great sound quality, punchy bass, and a large volume range - all at a reasonable price. I purchased two: one for my living room and one for my bedroom. The speaker I placed in my living room works well when I'm working from home. I use the speaker in my bedroom as a white noise machine for sleeping.Likes:* Rich bass for such a small speaker* Volume can get as loud as you'll likely want it. I've never tested the full range because anything above 70% will disturb my neighbors.* Alexa is pretty helpful, though I'm not a smarthome power user by an means* Integrates with Spotify, which I like much better than Apple music* Blends in to my furniture* Intelligent enough to detect which Echo I'm speaking to (bedroom vs. living room), and only play music or respond from that speaker.* Echo app store is a great idea that I didn't get with my Google home or Apple homepod. Didn't even know it existed before buying. I use the white noise app every night.Dislikes* The microphone is directional, so sometimes when I'm speaking to Alexa at an angle, it doesn't pick it up.* The ring of lights that announce when it's listening is facing down. If you place the Echo above eye level, you can't see it.* The white cord it comes with is pretty flimsy. I just hide it behind furniture, but could bother some people* Alexa app looks a little outdated. The functions you want are likely there, but it's hard to navigate until you get familiar with it

Really enjoying the 4th generation Echo, so far. I got the blue version which goes really well with my living room colors. The sound is great and you can adjust the sound settings in the Alexa app. Out of the box it has a nice bass sound and is okay as is. My only problem is that whenever I walk by it, I want to go bowling, but that's probably just me.

The basic echo dot has honestly subpar sound quality, so I was skeptical when I bought the premium version. This thing is fan-flipping-tastic! One of the best speakers that I've ever owned. Honestly so impressed!Also, you can't tell from the pictures, but its much bigger than the basic echo dot.

UPDATE 11/19/2020The speaker doesn't pick up my voice as well as the Gen 1 echo - find myself repeating commands more frequently. I was able to connect a Philips Hue bulb and it seems to be working well as a hub - it's a nice feature. The temperature sensor seems to be working well. I'm not a fan of the lights being underneath reflecting off the surface. It's more difficult to see them and I miss the large rotating volume knob which is much more intuitive to use. It was impossible to add the new speaker to my existing speaker group - seems to be a bug of some sort with the Alexa app (iOS). I couldn't stream to the device using my Amazom Music app, also seems to be a bug of some sort with the app (iOS).ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/23/2020I was hoping the audio quality of the 4th gen was going to be better than my first gen echo. I listened to them side by side and the don't sound THAT different - not worth the cost of replacement. The new version is louder, has slightly more pronounced bass and fills the room about the same when against the wall. The sound of the new one seems unbalanced. The highs are tinny and overbearing. Mids are understated and the bass is so-so. Overall the sound is top heavy and flat.Its width takes up a lot more space, about double over the first gen. The buttons on top are kind of difficult to press - they're hard to feel without looking, shaped into small symbols instead of chunky round buttons and not that responsive. The original echo's buttons were easier to navigate without looking.I don't mind the white cable because it blends in better with the white walls.If you don't mind having 2 devices, I would suggest going with an echo dot and buying a good quality bluetooth speaker. The flexibility of taking the speaker elsewhere with you and the sound quality will be much better.

I am an Echo fanatic and own the original Echo, the 3rd gen echo dot, the echo studio, and the little one which looks like a wall plug. This review is for the 4th gen echo with premium sound. The sound really is great. I am very impressed because it isn't very big. It has punchy bass... I mean it obviously isn't a 10"" woofer, but it really is nice. It has very good sound throughout the range. I have historically had Harman Kardon and Klipsch speakers so I will use those as a reference.I would say this speaker has superior sound than any single Klipsch or Harman Kardon bookshelf speaker I have previously owned. I am not comparing it to the entire system obviously with 5 speakers and a couple subwoofers. But any single speaker, including the center channel, I would put it up against. Most people would say that isn't a fair comparison because these are wireless stand alone units. Lets just say the sound is bright and covers all ranges very fairly, especially when considering the size of the speaker.I know this isn't a fair comparison, but we replaced the echo 3rd gen dot with this and it is so far superior. I mean of course right?Setup like all Echo's after the first one took like 15 seconds. I really love that about Amazon smart speakers and devices.

This was an awesome Christmas gift!  It does so many things and I have yet to discover its limitless potential!  Originally thought to be used as a good wi-fi ""radio"" for a remote room, it has presented itself to be so much more and should be a centerpiece in a more common location!  She can dim/brighten a ""smart"" lightbulb...but that is only basic!  She can connect to other devices and make phone calls!  She can listen for unusual sounds in the house (such as glass breaking) while I am away...and alert me!  She tells the corniest jokes, but I have repeated some of them.  I am only mentioning a small amount of what has already impressed me, but I am still learning.  Did I mention that she is giving me lessons in using ""The Force (as in ""Star Wars"")?  She is really fantastic...and I look forward to getting to know her better!  :-)

An immense amount of utility and sound for a small price tag. But I’m removing a star because: 1) notifications about things Amazon thinks I should buy are annoying and on by default 2) no easy white noise or sound machine functionality - when you ask to play whitenoise or rain sounds, it defaults to playing those sounds through skills that cost money to play for an extended period. Other smart speakers are preloaded with free, extended-play-time white noise and sound machine sounds.

Okay,I purchased this new build and I was really excited for the more space and new possibilities of making a smart home. So I decided to get a Echo because of the better sound and the hub(Zigbee) in it so I could have the option of using different kind of smart devices. Well that new house I purchased came with a ring security system. Very exciting! As I’m trying to set it up I’m quickly realizing that you have to have a Z-Wave hub to use it… really Amazon? You put a hub in your echo but it won’t work with the Ring system.. that you own. That was a bummer for sure. Who knows now when I’ll get a hub for this. 🤷🏼‍♀️ After that the Echo is nice. Not great at recognizing my voice but it will for my husband. Weird.

I ordered this Echo without diving into any of the reviews.  I have owned 3 Echo Dots (Gen 2) for a couple of years and I've been fairly happy with them.  This is the first Echo that I've purchased and after buying this thing, well, that's when I finally dove into the reviews.  Wow, what bad reviews -- I began regretting the purchase and I was going to return it without even giving it a try.  I'm glad I changed my mind and decided to give it an honest try.  To my surprise, this thing is great!  I really have no idea why there are so many bad reviews!  The sound quality is better than any of my Echo Dots.  Voice recognition has been spot-on.  Integration was easy to set-up and it fits right in with all my Dots.  The round shape is of no importance to me, I almost never look at any of my echo/dots, I know there there and I speak to them on a daily bases, they respond and play my music (with no commercials).  They blink green at me when I have a notification and remind me when I've set a timer... They all work as an intercom from room to room...  I unplug one of them and plug it in when I'm outside -- it take 5-10 seconds to reconnect to my wifi and now I have all the music I want sitting in my backyard living space.  Good Stuff!

General Annoyance - I bought this with the free globe offer - amazon lost it in delivery - there was no way to speak to anyone on their app so I just had to cancel it. BUT Cancelling it was difficult because it mysterious vanished from my recent orders, which seems devious as it was supposed to be a free included item - but I am hoping I am refunded its full price.PROsI new I wanted this for Spotify playing so I paid more to get the better speaker, and as I can connect it via bluetooth to my TV Soundbar /Bass it even sounds better. So overall happy but in truth I am no sound expert /musicphile.CONs- If you don't have an American accent and you want to set it to yours, you apparently lose functionality in the US but its not clear on what functionality to make it an easy choice.- I have it announce my Calendar but it does it twice. You can set the reminders to only announce once but it doesn't work for the calendar integration - its really annoying.- I like to clear up and delete my history - don't see any need for Amazon to have it. But to delete Activity you have to delete each Activity card and its like two taps. Again really annoying.- I have noticed things mysterious turn themselves on and off since setting this up. Can't tell if it's Alexa or the apps running the connected items to it. I don't see anything in Alexa history to suggest its Alexa and I haven't investigated further. i.e Xbox and lights mysteriously turn on.

My family uses our Set up every day. We have 4th gen Echo and an Echo Show in the living room and Breakfast nook respectively.And each bedroom has an Echo Dot. She controls our vacuum, coffee pot, thermostat, all the smart Lights, the Television, the outdoor lights, the doorbells, and the door Locks. Almost flawlessly. Occasionally we have to speak up or speak more clearly. But she preforms each task asked and 100% flawlessly performs each skill she is programed to. The app is incredibly easy to use. Until you get used to it and know what your doing and it continues to tell you to try mundane things like ""ask Alexa to tell a joke""  ""ask Alexa to call a family member"" ""you can video chat with a family member"" ""ask Alexa to drop in"" like... I know how to do it. I've had you for months.Controlling my strip LED's and music and Amazon everything is incredible. I am beyond satisfied. My entire family enjoys it.All in all I am 100% happy with my purchases. Even the more pricey ones. As making a smart home seems cheap. Until you see how much that stuff adds up too. I had to do it via 1 purchase a week for 3 weeks then 1 check no purchase. On repeat until I had it all. Now over a year later. I couldn't be happier. And my house couldn't be more fun.A nerd 🤓  in love with tech.Ryan

I purchased this Echo to upgrade from a first generation Echo. The quality of audio of this device, versus the first generation, is outstanding. What I like the most is that this Echo can still hear my wakeup word even while music is playing, something that was extremely difficult to do on the first gen Echo without having to SCREAM the wakeup word several times. Those two things are the main positive differences for me. I do not use the ultrasound motion sensor on this device, nor the Zigbee hub (because although I can connect Zigbee stuff to it, the current status of those devices is never registered/updated; totally useless). A couple cool additional features over the old device is the ability to use different voices and multilanguage. A big dislike for me is that the light ring is at the bottom. I prefer it at the top, like on the first gen device, since I was able to see it from any angle without obstructions. Right now, I cannot see it unless I am in front of the device.

I had to buy a new, more expensive, larger, uglier Alexa device because the old one could not connect devices on a modern Wi-Fi router with 5G. She is not capable of answering almost any question, including her own model or specifications. And after a dozen tries, she still could not connect to my device. Alexa used to be far simpler, far less expensive, and work far better.Is it time to convert to Google smart home, or is that just as bad?Addition: After posting this review, Amazon Customer Service called me and was able to assist me in connecting this Echo to my devices. I have added two stars to reflect that service.I remain disappointed that I had to buy two new Echoes and devices to connect to them merely because Comcast replaced my router with a newer model. And it is still the case that this Echo provides less assistance than the older models I had.  Also, having lived with it for a few days, I have noticed that the sound quality is worse than the older models, even though it looks like it has a bigger speaker.

This review is for what this is, not what it is not. I've used Echos for years and it keeps getting better. This is not an audiophiles system and shouldn't be compared. It is a very adequate system for those of us who aren't anal about sound.I have two connected with the subwoofer in a 5th wheel trailer. I'm completely pleased with the sound. The bass was a bit overpowering, but I was able to adjust that with built in equalizer.It seems which ever echo microphone I'm closest to picks up commands and hasn't failed yet. I'm about 8 feet from either one and it always hears and responds well.These have the built in hub so I'm able to control lights which is cool.If you've had other echos you know what they do. I don't see how you can go wrong with them.If there is a downside its that I use a separate Dolby atmos 5.1 system for movies, TV etc. Maybe someday echos will come with rear channels?So to update this, I connected the two echo gen 4s to Firestick which was easy, however the result is not a happy ending. I still enjoy the Echo gen 4 has music etc streaming source, but this does not provide a theater experience like a designated 5.1 or 7.1 system. I found I had to crank the volume up all the way to get acceptable sound level.

The Echo speaker is a great little upgrade on an Echo Dot. And while it doesn't boast the sound profile of a Bose or Sonos, at its price point its a steal. While the dots are nice simple speakers, they are really more voice assistants with a speaker. The Echo is a solid speaker with nice sound, especially when paired, that has a voice assistant as well as a hub for zigbee, z-wave, & Ring devices. Probably my only issue is more of an Amazon Music issue. The streaming reliability with Amazon Music has been a bit spotty on occasion. Ironically, when those issues arise I switch to Spotify without issue. So I suspect my issue is more Amazon Music.

This is the fifth Echo device I've purchased.  My 2 previous Echos are the Plus 2nd Generation.  Those are excellent.  I wanted to purchase another of those but this one appears to have replaced that.  First of all I wouldn't consider this to be gray, it looks black.  Second, they supply you with a WHITE power chord instead of black.  This doesn't make sense and it looks stupid.  The chord is also significantly shorter than the chord on my previous devices.  The worst part is the microphone rarely picks up my voice on the first, and sometimes second, try.  I have to yell at it to recognize me.  This is extremely annoying and I never have this issue with my other Echos.  The only plus is that the sound quality when playing music seems to be as good as the Echo Plus.

The new Echo (4th Gen) is nice and the sound is rich and pleasing to the ear when listening to music.  I was not satisfied with the Alexa voice quality even with 2 tweeters.  Her voice sounds muddy even with the Trebble cranked.  You will have to satisfy reducing the Bass and feverishly play with the tonal controls to solve this at the sacrifice of musical quality.  Finding the tonal controls is frustrating in the app and I'm not impressed with it ""automatically adapting to any room"".  It's just marketing hype.  So only 4 stars.

This Echo is the opposite of the choices you see on your typical dating app -- it is much more attractive in real life than it is in its photos.  I was reluctant to buy it because I thought it was ugly, but I was happily surprised to find that it is actually quite attractive.Some quick background:  Along with this Gen 4 Echo, I own two Gen 1 Echos, two Gen 2 Echos, and two Gen 3 Echos, along with several non-Amazon Alexa-capable.The sound quality is a small, but noticeable, step forward from the previous (3rd) generation Echo.  It is not a big enough step forward that you should replace your 3rd Gen Echo, however.  What IS nice is that it has a built in thermostat (so you can ask Alexa what the inside temp is, which could be a nice feature when out of town).  Also, it has the built-in hub capability.Compared to 1st and 2nd Gen Echos, the sound and microphone quality is massively improved.  I retired a Gen 1 Echo when I bought this one, and the difference is huge.  I would recommend replacing your first or second generation Echo with this one.  I would hold on to your third generation Echo.

This is an update.  After my initial review I was co tasted by Amazon tech support.  After a couple of sessions I asked for a replacement device.  A new Alexa was sent out and this new device has been solid.  I’m returning the old device and hopefully they can figure out the issue and prevent other problems in the future. That you Amazon for making this right.  After this point is my initial review.....  I own several Alexa devices.  This would be the fourth we own.  First the good.  I like the looks.  The sound quality is pretty good also.  However, the unit does not stay connected to the internet.  Most of the time when I ask Alexa to do something she tells me she lost connection to the internet.  I can unplug it and she's ready to go.  Come back later and it's the same issue all over again with no internet connection.  I take this device and swap locations with another Alexa device and the same issue happens.  It works for a bit and then loses internet connection while the old devices I own don't miss a beat.  This appears to be a device issue vs a home internt issue.  What a bummer this one does not work.  I expected better

I like my echo, its fun! I have 2, with premier sound and 1 echo dot. I also got the dot for my sister in law. She has Audible. It was for Christmas, so she could listen to her books with out head phones. I wanted to set Alexa up, so I could hear  news or music all around my house. When I got my first two, I was able to pair them on different floors of my house. Alexa then updated their app and changed it.  Got my third one, and could only sync the two on the first floor. They had to be in the same room. The two that were originally paired did stay paired. I did sync the two on the first floor  and it worked for a while. Then they got out of sync and started echoing. Drove my husband crazy two mornings. I woke up with him screaming at it. Thought he was going to have a heart attack. Had to un-sync them and use them separately. That defeated the purpose I got them for. Many times it does not understand us. I have to send in reports about this thru the Alexa app. Some times I get good answers, sometimes not. I do like having them. They are useful, and give me something to use during covid. Could they improve the AI? Yes, but they give me a new experience. Not prefect, but I like them.

But I’m sure I’ll get an actual hub in the future if their compatible zigbee products don’t grow and the routines stay basic.Oh and the sound is actually pretty awesome. Great bass!

I waffled between the Echo Studio, Echo 4, or no new editions (I have a bunch of devices, as do many).  I did want to try the Echo sub.  When the Echo 4 price dropped I bought two and also bought a sub.  I mounted the 4s on small tripods (not sure if it changed the sound much).I know the Studios are bigger with bigger components and bigger sound but my space is not that large. The savings of $130 per unit pushed me over. I figured eventually if the Studios go on sale I might buy a couple and replace a couple of Dots I still use.I have every device, including two Echo shows, in a whole house group.  I love this option.Disclaimer:. I am not an audio expert and am older and starting to experience some hearing loss.  Still, the improvement is pronounced from the original Echo and the Dots (a couple different eras) and I am happy with my choice.I have not connected the new speakers and sub to my Fire TV that I actually bought with that intention. I have a decent sound bar and sub that works with all devices and I decided to leave the new Echo speakers for music streaming for now.The sad part is my home is running out of outlets.

I like almost everything about this product.Unfortunately, it announces “NOW CONNECTED TO [DEVICE NAME]” whenever you activate it.If you’re connecting this as a PC speaker be prepared to be woken up at 2am when your PC installs a random update and restarts.Research this issue online and you’ll see it has been known for years and Amazon does nothing to fix it. There are a few bandaids you can stick on like restarting the device, but none of them work over time.Absolutely stunning lack of consideration to how the thing will be used in real life. The worst part is I’m sure they could easily patch this online (other people have literally developed desktop applications to override the functionality) but they just…don’t.

I'm seeing a lot of complaints about the voice recognition on the Echo 4.  I was worried about this until I tried it.  Our previous Echo lasted about 5 years.  We had to replace it after it was dropped one too many times.  After some research (and reading a lot of complaints about the voice recognition), I got this about a month ago, and I just wanted to say that the voice recognition problem is not a problem.  Further, this sounds a lot better: decent bass and brighter highs.  Other than that, it's an Echo.  Just say ""Alexa"" and you're off to the races.  IMHO, don't let the supposed voice-recognition issue keep you from buying the Echo 4.

I currently have a 2nd Gen Echo and 2 Echo Dots. I listen to the 2nd Gen Echo the most and decided to give this a try to upgrade the sound. My favorite thing about the Alexa products is being able to network them together into groups. The sound quality on this was a step up from my 2nd Gen. That is where the good stops. This device would frequently stop playback altogether. Whether it was Amazon Music, a Flash Briefing or a 3rd party app it would just stop playing. I could not get my devices to play in a group with this device as part of the network. All my devices were hooked up to the same 2.4 ghz wifi network. I deleted and re-added all the devices multiple times. I spent countless hours on the phone with support. Everything worked fine until I added in this devices. When I removed it, the groups worked fine. The last straw was when it was in the middle of delivering a severe weather notification and it just stopped working. I will stick with the older, slightly less great sounding tech because it reliable works. This is getting returned.

First off, I didn't upload an image, because the Echo unit I have looks exactly the same as every other pic of it. It's pretty. Though, I don't know why if Amazon redesigned Echo units, why not offer more color choices this time around?????? Why not a red, green, eggplant purple?? I also liked the turn-dial volume control on the older unit. I think it offered more exact control and ease of use, as well as the light ring that used to be on top, as opposed to now being in the very bottom of the unit. A person could see the entire ring when it was in top, now you can only see the portion of the ring you're facing, as it rotates and disappears behind the opposite side of the unit, ....like the dark side of the moon. The Sound however, I think is an improvement. The old unit sounded great considering it's size. But this unit, although not noticebly bigger, has better bass, and wider overall sound quality. And SOUND is the whole point for me. Alexa's assistance with information and home-living is very helpful, but I purchased Echo for the ease of placing music in every room and access to just about any song I can think of.  And with that priority in mind, I think this new unit is improved.

I bought a pair of these. A 4K fire stick and the sub. It was a bit of a challenge to get everything connected and working. The sub is decent, not super loud if that’s what you are going for. Once you connect the 2 echos with the sub you can’t change any of the sound settings individually.We listen to SiriusXM a lot and it keeps dropping the signal and going to static. Spotify works fine. Not sure why it doesn’t seem to like satellite radio. We have very strong wifi with a mesh system so it’s not a wifi issue.Overall the echos and sub combo sound good and it does the job of deleting a soundbar under my tv above my mantle. You’re not getting theater quality sound but it’s good for the price on prime days.

Let me start by saying that I like multifunction gadgets especially for my smart home setup. I had this item in my cart for a month before buying as I wanted to make sure that this was not an emotional purchase. I can tell you now that the wait was totally worth it as the device blew me away when I had it setup. The sound is a big step up to the echo dots I have. Deep bass and decent highs make the music come alive. You do have to find a good spot though. I would recommend placing it in a corner with the least clutter as show in the pic. Placing it on top a wooden furniture will also enhance the bass.Now to the smart home functions. The device was able to detect my smart devices fairly easily. Be sure to have your smart devices in pairing mode before trying to discover. So far there have been some hit and miss in terms of configuring my smart devices. However once they are up and running they work fine. My tip here is to give your smart bulbs etc easy to pronounce names. This will prevent alexa having to ask you which one did you mean etc.I do have one thing I disliked, a software peeve. The alexa app needs a redesign in terms of it not being very intuitive for handling devices. I have a samsung smart thing and the interface is way better in managing my smart device.

Really like the improvements. So we decided to upgrade a basic one we had to have better sound in the bedroom.  We use the echoes to listen to our Audible books together.

The 4th Gen Alexa Echo ""enhanced"" sound device sports the oddity of a white electric cord coming out of an entirely black case, but frankly if you have a number of cords in the area, it's a help in differentiating its cord from the others.  *shrugs shoulders*  It really hurts nothing esthetically unless one is very, very picky.  As for audio, this is the first ""Alexa"" device I've owned so I cannot compare it to previous models' sound quality.  The bass is okay, but I agree with others who say the treble speakers used in the device could have been better.  You won't get component stereo hi-fi sound out of the device and there's no way I've found that will boost the frequencies on the high end. It sounds more like what comes from speakers with the ""tweeters"" not working very hard and the mid-range speakers trying to make up for that fact.  I would still recommend the device for its functionality, but while possibly better sounding than the standard Alexa 4th Gen Echo, this version's ""enhanced"" sound quality will still be underwhelming to audiophiles.

 Only does on /off , very basic stuff.  I don't want to wear a head set. I really wish Xbox didn't get rid of kinect. I don't use game chat often,  but when I do, it would be nice if this worked. Turns TV on off , can pause and play,  basic stuff. Saying ""Alexa, tell Xbox to record that"" is too much,  too slow, and inconsistent.Using two for a sound bar is a fail. Buy a real sound bar. It's a nice thing to have if you only care about music. Then they actually sound good!

Update: 28 Jan 2022I've really had it with this thing; it's a hot, steaming pile.  I recently went through a phase where the ring would light yellow, letting me know that there were new notifications waiting.  I'd say, ""Alexa, read my notifications,"" and the Echo would tell me that I had no notifications.  Asking a second time would usually result in success.  Then this morning, the Echo decided to shout to the world that we'd added breakfast sandwiches to our shopping list.  Mind you, I NEVER touch the volume controls -- on the device or on the app -- except to reset them when the Echo decides to shout at me.  This morning it shouted so loud that it woke two of my children on ANOTHER FLOOR.  I'm done with this piece of junk.  It's now packed away in my basement, and I've brought my Gen1 back online.----------I was an early and aggressive adopter of Echo products over the years.  I bought my Gen1 Echo during the pre-release phase, have had several Dots, and now have several Shows as bedroom alarm clocks.  So when I bought my Gen4 Echo to replace my original Gen1, I did so with great expectations.  Let me tell you how disappointed I am.The first thing I noticed was that when paired to my iPad (which sits right next to the Echo on my kitchen island), the audio frequently crackles and drops.  This was never an issue with my Gen1, and the behavior has persisted across pairing to my iPhone and two different iPads.  That makes me pretty confident that the issue is in the Echo, and not in the attached devices.The next major issue is with volume control on the Gen4.  I still haven’t figured it out.  I have tried the on-device controls and the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app, but there seems to be no logic to what volume the Echo responds to me.  I can ask Alexa for a weather report and all is fine, then a few seconds later ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, only to hear the Echo shout the response.  The Echo will announce a reminder softly, and then boom my notifications when I ask.  Adjusting and re-adjusting the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app solves the problem temporarily, but the issue resumes not long after.More recently, the Echo has started playing music after announcing reminders or playing announcements.  It wasn’t playing music before, and no one asked it to start playing music; it just does it on its own.  (This behavior was kind of funny the first few times, but now I’m getting tired of telling the Echo to stop playing music after it tells me to take out the trash or clean the guinea pig cage…)And then there’s the “spinning blue ring issue” that seems to have cropped up recently.  Frequently over the last few days, I’ve caught the Echo with the light ring illuminated blue, with a slightly brighter blue indicator spinning round and round.  It will do this for minutes at a time, stop, and then just start doing it again later.  During this time, the device is non-responsive.I never saw these issues with the Gen1, nor do my Shows seem to have so many issues.  But I’m thoroughly disappointed with the Gen4.  It truly makes me wish I had my Gen1 back.  My opinion:  Save your money and avoid this one.  Maybe the Gen5 will be better.

Connected without a smart phone-hmm. It may have taken me 2 days but I did it! I am a senior. I choose to avoid Smart Phones with apps waiting to be hacked (yes, hard to believe but urban survival is still possible using a flip phone). After I got through my outrage over ""Smart Phone only"" connection instructions, well that and multiple calls with Amazon techs who confirmed connection only by a smart phone app, I ""registered"" my new Alexa on my tablet, restarted the tablet, and presto, I was connected. Age persevered again ;-) Don't give up because the new deep bass and room temp reading is fabulous.

Where to even start... this is the worst Echo device I own.I have several generations of dots that have better sound & can hear me without me having to yell... I bought this to replace my original Echo, which was taller but (to me at least) more aesthetically pleasing all around.But the look of it is besides the point... it rarely recognizes what I have to say which never happened on any other device, & I have to yell at it- because talking to it induces ""whisper mode"" which I can say from other echo devices is usually because you are ACTUALLY whispering to the device.It's a complete failure on sound quality when playing music... and to add insult to injury, they may call the device color ""glacier white"" but it's more a ""dirty snow grey""... now onto a less significant, but equally annoying detail... why did they make this round? It's wider than my old Echo, & the material just collects dust... the whole device is truly a heinous monstrosity I can't wait to be rid of if/when they come out with another version that is no longer this shape or low quality.The only reason this gets 2 stars is because I like the thermostat feature & I got it on sale so I can't complain about its price (other than it's not worth sale price let alone full price)... I honestly don't know why Amazon created this, & I hope they go back to a device that has better sound quality and voice recognition instead of focusing on a design that is ultimately superfluous at the end of the day (not to give permission to make it any uglier, but please prioritize function over form next time!)

now let me tell you, i dont like to write reviews, so im doing this because i want to put down talkers in their  place about this speaker.1. To start with for the small size of this speaker, the sound that is coming out of this is room filling and i mean room filling. good bass that is noticeable  and great highs and midrange.2. The materials is good and the speaker itself is nice and heavy to handle the music, so it wont be rattling around or hopping off the table.3. I also own a harman kardon onxy 3 that i use with the alexa input and there is not much of a difference is sound quality and i mean it, on battery the onxy sounds less than the echo , only when plugged in you here the slight difference in the bass line and a little louder. the hk cost 150us and the echo jus under 100 bucks. so now im going to mount these bad boys all over the house and you can jus imagine pairing them in stereo mode. wow

This is the first echo/Alexa that I have an issue with. I swear she is a little tin eared or something. I can be 30 feet from my echo dot and that one can hear you whispering her name. This new fangled ball shaped thing can be 3 feet away in a quiet room and she doesn't hear you! You actually have to raise your voice to an uncomfortable level for it to perk up and listen. If there is anyone talking nearby, you better use your outside voice and put some bass in it! I swear this is got to be Amazon screwing with me! Alexa has become like all the other woman in my life, they ignore me and pretend they don't hear me. Some nights I wake up in a cold sweat fearing she walked out on me and took the dog! I may have to chain her down or something. I wish she listened better because she sounds great when she decides to work. I would return it for an exchange but the 2 day shipping took almost 2 weeks and I have separation anxiety and abandonment issues. So forget that! So hopefully you are luckier if you buy one! I would recommend it, but if she doesn't listen out of the box, it won't get better as you wait so just kick her out of the house and tell her to go back to her parents basement.

I bought two of these during a sale and traded in my 1st and 2nd generation devices. They are solid units, but fall short in the following ways:1) Voice recognition not as good as previous generations. There are times when I attempt to wake the device up and have to shout. I was able to wake the other devices up with more of a conversational tone. There are also times when it doesn't appear to be able to process what I said, so it will just disregard everything and not say anything.2) The speaker is good, but I can see why others have complained about it not being 360. One of my devices is placed facing the dining area. When I am in the kitchen, the music does not sound as good since it is facing away from me. This was not an issue with the 2nd generation is previously replaced.3) Not a big deal, but it would be nice if they sent out a darker cord with the dark colored units. They did this previously.In the end, if your device needs to be replaced or you don't currently have one, then this is a solid device. If you have a 2nd generation (or higher), then maybe skip this one.

On prime day, for $60, it sounds about as good as a $60 speaker is expected to sound. But if I paid more than $60 I'd be disappointed. If you have the space a good sound bar works well and sounds great with a dot. But in small spaces where flat surfaces are at a premium, but you still want ""good"" sound, this a good choice. The sound is richer and fills the room better than just a dot. If you buy new from Amazon, using the aleza app, it practically sets itself up. Great for the Kitchen, Master Bath, Kids Bedroom or small apartment. But if your an audiophile it won't impress you as a stand alone source for music in larger living areas. Its good, and better than a dot, but not a value over the price of a good sound system. You get what pay for, think in terms of the speaker inside, given the price what do expect that priced speaker to sound like, don't expect it too sound like $400 to $800 Bose, because it doesn't cost close to that. Its a good value, but don't expect the moon.

This was a gift and I'm grateful for it. The speaker isn't the best quality sound but with enough paired through out the house could be pretty great. The functions of my pandora don't work like they do on the app which sucks. Overall it's cool to ask questions like ""what's the weather"" or ask for your notifications. Not the best for actually listening to music if you like it loud and clear!!!

After the write up I was expecting a huge sound improvement.  I've got it in a good place for music and bought it to replace my older Echo just for that reason.  But I can't tell a difference.  There is nothing wrong with this device.  It works just as well as the previous Echo but no better.So no real complaint about the quality but this is not a much better sound than any other.  Actually the Dots sound about the same.  I think the only answer if a better sound quality is desired is to spend a ton more money on one of the bluetooth alternatives.

I like everything about the new echo so far but I still can’t figure out why it comes with a white power supply. I purposely held off buying this device when it first came out thinking maybe they would add the black power supply. My old echo just wasn’t cutting it anymore so I broke down and got it.

I think my previous echo plus sounded better then the newer echo 4th Gen. To be honest. Also it came with a white plug which is ridiculous since the unit is all black. The sound is still good but a bit disappointing that my previous unit was better. Had to replace it as it kept skipping.

This is our first Alexa device. Very easy to hook up and no issues so far.  Seems to work well.  The premium sound though is another issue.  I have a high end stereo system and listen to premium sound quite a bit, that being said, this sounds ok, but is not premium sound.  Maybe an enhanced radio would better describe the sound. Still, we like it for the convenience it affords to our daily life.  Not sure though if I’d buy another one.

I had purchased this Echo to replace my 1st generation Echo Plus.  The mics on the Echo plus were a little sluggish so I thought why not upgrade and move my echo plus to another part of the house that is less used.  Well the new Echo showed up a little early and I even went through the payment plan.  I thought that the new generation should have all kinds of woops and whistles than what I originally had.Well the first thing that I enjoyed was the integration of dual languages.  With me learning Spanish this I thought would be a fun feature.  Well it seams that this version has still a lot of issues.  My commands are not recognized very often.  When I try to play something from xm it just errors.  I have to use my echo show to play on the network I choose.  Now it plays fine on the new Echo but it just does not seem to take commands very well.  The spanish commands are hit and miss but right on with the echo show.Overall I am very disappointed with the replacement.  If it wasn't for my smart home features I may even consider sending it back till they can get it right.  The first and second gen plus is still very cheap and I could just replace it with that from ebay or something.(update)  So tech support reached out to me and was concerned as well.  It seems that my Echo Show is less sensitive to commands than the echo plus.  The echo plus being more sensitive, would not know how to respond if there was an extra word in the command.  As for the Language issue well it worked fine the first time the tech was listening but the second time it would not respond saying it had a limited vocab.  They will work on it.  Because they were so nice about it I told them I would update my original review to include their exceptional service.

I bought this because my google Jbl link 10 speaker has been acting up and this one was supposed to be better and better sound  quality and louder but its not at all my neighbor has an older Alexa echo plus and hers is ten times louder and its one of the first models. Very disappointed in this item and I would of known I would of got the older model but I went by the reviews and what it said. Also even when the mic is muted it keeps talking and is listening I can tell by it changing colors and it is supposed to stay red when muted. It also doesn't understand anything you ask it half he time and I just got this not even a week ago.

Amazon CloudCam will be decommission at Dec 4th and my smart lock will be not longer access from smart phone. I spent over $300 for CloudCam and Smart Lock, but Amazon just decommission Amazon Key and Cloudcam with $80.00 as complimentary. It is bad.This Cam has very short cable and do not have person motion detection as well as no at home feature(turn of cam). Alexa does not support ""Kwikset 99160-020 Smartcode 916 Traditional Smart Lock Touchscreen Electronic Deadbolt Door Lock"". I need Jeff bezos to give all customer an answer and gave me a smart lock which will work with Alexa for remote access.======Below are from Amazon.com's Customer service team, but AMAZON do not take actions to resolve the issue that AMAZON caused, but ask customer to buy more device to solve the issue.Thank you for the reply - Unfortunately, the model you described:""Kwikset 99160-020 Smartcode 916 Traditional Smart Lock Touchscreen Electronic Deadbolt Door Lock with SmartKey Security and Z-Wave Plus.""Is not directly compatible with an Echo's zigbee hub, it uses z-wave a similar but different protocol, which would necessitate a hub.That being said, you still have 2 options here, you can try to use the documentation I provided to get your earlier smart lock hooked up to your Echo.Please note that instead of using the key app and trying to pair with the smart lock, you just have to tell the Echo ""Alexa, discover devices"" after resetting the smart lock or putting it in pairing mode. (I understand the documentation is old, but zigbee is standardized so there's a good chance we can pair with the lock).Alternatively, you can try a z-wave lock and use a compatible hub, I have 2 suggestions for hubs linked below for you to choose at your convenience - each of which will work with both Alexa and Google assistant:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TWDNQ5Q/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D19VVTX/

So I bought this to replace a 2nd gen echo plus with the smart home hub because I was trying to find a regular 3rd gen echo (the taller rounded one) to set up a stereo pair with but found them all discontinued. So i bought this version (renewed) and put the other echo downstairs. The sound quality is pretty good but I feel it's not as strong or has the same bass response as the original echo plus. Haven't set another echo up with it yet so I'll hold off on my audio judgements. In terms of voice recognition, this thing can't hear me calling it half the time when I'm in bed only 3 feet away, the other one was better with that. Not only can't it hear me, but half the time it doesn't respond correctly or perform the right action I request. For the price this thing should have the clock built in as a standard feature that you can disable at will. I'm going to buy the matching regular echo, but I gotta say I feel like this unit is a downgrade from my OG echo plus.

I loved (past tense) having echos at home so this unit as an echo gets 4 stars but as a smart home hub it fails miserable and gets 1 star.I bought this unit to control smart devices at my office. At home I use smart things with echo dots all over and it works great when our echos aren’t deaf or, now suddenly, trying to advertise crap after being given a conmand (if you’re reading this Amazon I’m about to rip every Amazon device out because of that bs).At my office though I just needed a small amount of devices to control and make a few automations with and I thought this would kill 2 birds with one stone. Man was I wrong.My first complaint is everything after two days shows up as unresponsive. It still works with voice commands or in the app but you constantly have the darn thing chiming back at you to say “table warmer is unavailable please check the Alexa app or this device is offline please check the Alexa app for further information” and you can’t make it stop. Considering I’m using it in my massage studio this is beyond annoying when it blurts that out while Al client is already on the table.Routines suck too. You cannot use more than one sensor in a routine.  I wanted it to do certain things like it the door sensor opens and you detect motion turn on this this and this. No.  You can only use one either the door or the motion but not both. This hub has been out for 5 years how is it still this basic?Want to see the history of your sensors? Tough s***. You cannot see a log (at least I cannot find where and I’ve looked) of the sensor.  Did someone come into my office when I wasn’t there? Who the heck knows because I can’t see the log.  The guard thing is annoying. I just wanted what I thought was basic smart home stuff. What I got was the kindergarten version of a smart home hub.Amazon you are FAILING miserably between the Alexa advertisements and interruptions and the smart home hub. Like I mentioned earlier I’m about to rip every Amazon assistant from my home and find something better if they don’t fix it. If I ask for the weather that’s all I want. I don’t want you rambling on about a new skill I can buy or something else you can do. Just do what is ask and stop. But no it’s all about money.I used to love these things now I just find myself yelling at them because they go deaf and can’t turn on a simple light or telling it to shut up because it goes off the rails.  I have one dot in the living room that can hear EVERYTHING, I have the same versions in each room and that one dot almost never misses a beat when I ask it to do something even in other rooms. The others I can be standing two feet from and it can’t hear a truck plowing through the house to save it. In total I have 6 new dots at home and this 1 plus at work.  Thinking of just getting the home pods and being done with Amazon altogether.

The speakers have great sound. I have set up two in my bedroom for stereo sound and they are great. Easy setup. I have Echos throughout my house and I really like them. However, for some reason these two new ones don't do as well on voice recognition as my other ones (a variety of models) do. Maybe they just need to adjust to my voice, I don't really know. They still work well. I like the fact that they can tell me the room temperature as well. Sounds minor but it's a very nice feature. Also, the round shape is not my favorite from a looks standpoint, but I think they are shaped like this for better sound. All-in-all, I really like these.

If Alexa would actually comprehend what is being said, it would be rated higher. Also, it is apparent Alexa does not recognize your music library on Amazon Music.

Sorry is probably the most stated word Alexa has within the vocabulary.

We were so pleased with our Echo Dot, that we decided to get this device also. It is our 3rd sound device to go along with a couple Alexa plugs.  We expected a decidedly improved sound with this device. But, while it does in fact provide you with a bit deeper sound and tone quality, I am not sure that the difference between this and the small Dot devices that we had justifies the price difference. It also had a much larger footprint thus being a bit clumsy with the additional room that it takes up. All that said, we do like the device and believe that if you happen to get one that you will certainly be pleased with it.

I had a previous Echo version that wasn't integrating well with some of the new devices I purchased. I used the Amazon Alexa device trade in program and with trade in value and the current deal that was being offered I only paid $30 total for the device. This device works better with voice recognition, commands, has better sound, and it solved the issue I was having with the older one always picking up when other devices were closer. I followed all of the set-up recommendations with the old one but it didn't help. This worked immediately once set-up was completed.

I bought two and paired them right away. Amazing sound for such a small speaker. They pair together and with Alexa very well. When put in Theater mode with a FireTV it fails often and has to be unpaired and then re-paired. This doesn’t bother me, but sure bothers the family who do not know what they are doing or don’t have access. Other than the FireTV part this is 5 stars, but I had to remove one due to that frequently occurring problem between two Amazon products.

I have 6 Amazon Devices namely Echo dot 1st Get, Echo Dot 4th Gen, Echo Show 1st Gen, Echo show 8 1st Gen, Amazon Fire stick and Amazon fire tablet. I use them for different things throughout my house and it has been good with my smart home. The only shortfall I noticed with this is that you have to shout for it the pick your voice and I'm sure I am experiencing this same problem with my Echo Show 8. So my thinking is the bigger the speakers, the likelihood your voice bounces off them unlike the smaller ones. I bought some ZigBee devices and I'm trying to see how easy they can be integrated to this instead of getting a smart home hub. I guess an update will be put up later.

Sound quality is fine.Has told me hundreds of times that the only way to play specific songs is with amazon music, implying that deezer and spotify or anything other than amazon will not work on the device.Amazon should really correct this.Impossible to sign in to a hotel wifi that has its own sign in screen.Only device I have that does not connect to the wifi in my home, though it does connect to mobile hotspot.Seems to listen and record sometimes when I don't use the wake word.Usually horrible with foreign language artist recognition.Often not that intuitive with basic questions.Too bulky and heavy to be considered a good travel speaker.Mixes up accounts in my family, and will ask things like would I like to reorder medicine.Gives notifications of everything my Mom ordered for Christmas, even after I turn off notifications.Customer support is good, though if there is a problem with the device you are required to mail it to them even if you are in another country.Really the ease of use of the technology is quite unimpressive.Children like talking to alexa.The worst is setting up a new wifi, amazon should really improve this.I think my next smart speaker purchase will be a sonos or a google, because what do I have to lose?The only thing making me stay with amazon is that they allow deezer in every country I have been to so far, with google its hit or miss.Overall, I went from really enjoying Amazon smart speakers to almost dreading the experience.

This speaker is okay. I wouldn't call it great or exceptional, but still a nice sounding speaker. There isn't much bass, although it does have crisp clear sound. I would recommend buying 2 or more and connect them in the Alexa App. This will give you a much broader and more full sound. Also pair it with the Echo Sub and you will have a nice sounding music system with one hell of a kick to it. The Echo Studio is a far better performing speaker.

It even helped with crossword puzzles!As the years went by it became harder hear clearly what Alexa was saying so I upgraded when a new one  came out. When this new one came out with the improved audio and it was on a great sale, I jumped on it. I am so glad that I got it because i  can hear it clearly and I use it all the time! And I love the new shape!!!

Seriously, charcoal colored units shipped with white cords?  I replaced 2 Echo Plus units. The original Echoes along with other Echo devices always setup and installed without a hitch.  1) After spending much time on the phone with Amazon techs, we were unable to get the units to connect with our home network. After the calls I reset the devices and tried again putting in my network name and password. After it failed, I used my PC and Amazon's Echo website to set up. This failed as well; however I then turned on my iPhone hot spot. They connected immediately. I completed the setup via hot spot. I then turned off the hot spot and the Echoes connected to my home network. It's possible it could be a WiFi 6 issue, but all my other devices and older Echo units connected without a hitch. (ASUS AiMesh system with 2 RT-AX88U and 2 RT-AC 88U routers all connected via ethernet cables)2) One of the units disconnected from wifi later in the day and did not reconnect automatically. I unplugged the unit and plugged back into power. It reconnected and has been working well for 24 hours. 3) I also experienced an issue this morning when I used the app to pause a radio stream. I received a message ""unable to pause"".

I replaced my 1st generation Ehop after all these years wiuth the 4th generation model. It sounds great, looks good, responds well. My only complaint is, like others have complained about other earlier Echo products, the output level of the combination output/input jack is simply not high enough to drive an external system with any quality. I've tried connecting via good quality cables to various external systems, including some very high end amp and speakers, and the output level from the Echo is just too low, such that even the best, lowest signal to noise ratio units have a hard time amplifying the signal to a loud enough level without introducing noise and other artifacts. Serious design flaw, Amazon, for a flagship product.

Okay, so I have had an Echo 1st Gen with hub for about three years now.  I also have purchased several Echo Dots in that time.  I like how each sounds but I have to admit the Echo 1st Gen with hub sounds great, much better than the Dots.  I didn't and don't have a problem with it, it still sounds great and responds great.  It sounds so great I had been planning on getting a second one to go in another room for some time.  So since I kept seeing the new 4th Gen Echo advertised for around $70 I couldn't pass it up.  I read the reviews about having to repeat ""Alexa"" being an issue but I didn't realize how bad it would be until I ran into the problem myself.  I have it in my bedroom on my nightstand and you would think that no matter what position you are in it would hear you when you are lying on the bed with the speaker about a foot away.  But that's not the case, if you are facing away from the speaker you almost have to yell ""Alexa"", so that your sound bounces off one of the walls, to get a response.  And this is the case no matter where you are in the room.  You have to face the speaker to get a constant response.  I don't have that problem with the 1st Gen speaker.  If it only had only happened a couple of times I wouldn't care, but it's constant.But not all is bad about the speaker.  I know that some of the reviews mentioned about it's tone being a little too low.  I actually like the sound it puts out.  This is far better than my 1st Gen and the Dots.  After all the ranting about having to repeat my demands, the sound, at least for me, does make up for it and I do plan on buying another one to get a more stereo effect.I still don't think that it warrants four or five stars because it is a smart speaker, and if previous generations function better at performing that function, there is definitely room for improvement for this gen.

A very poor “whole house” audio solution. What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough “free with Prime” music that you want to listen to, it won’t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn’t further Amazon’s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.“Whole House Audio”??? That’s a joke. It won’t let you play your own music from your phone on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play radio apps on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play audio books on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the “everywhere group”. Basically it’s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only “whole house audio” for being tied to Amazon’s pay streaming music.If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the “everywhere group”: First, it will tell you that you can’t play music on the “everywhere group” because music is already playing on another unit. But It’s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.Let’s say you’re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don’t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that has  another unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn’t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more “stuff”.So you’ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don’t expect true whole house audio and don’t expect them to work together as a group of units. All you did was purchase the “gateway drug” for Amazon’s selling machine.

I bought an Amazon Echo for the specific purpose of automating some devices in my home that my wife, now in a wheelchair, can no longer reach.  I have lamps in four rooms now under voice control so she can at least turn on one lamp in each room and see her way around.  Hoping to upgrade my thermostat to one that Alexa can control as well.  I was surprised at the quality of the sound from the Alexa smart speaker when I've asked it to play a variety of tunes.  For such a small thing, it really sounds good.  And Alexa seems to understand my requests very well - better than I was expecting.  Am finding that Alexa can do a lot of things I hadn't anticipated.  I use it more for playing music than almost anything else!

The amount of packaging that I received this product in was a bit over the top, but I’m and exceedingly happy with the echo itself! Between integration with the other smart devices in my home and easy commands to use those devices my experience so far has been phenomenal. The sound quality is excellent for listening to anything from calm lo-fi to punchy bass filled hip-hop. Great product!

Love it!! Had a few problems setting the whole system together, no worries Alexa helped. Ordered the Hub with 2 dots. Charcoal Enhanced Smart Hub was on back order. Almost a 2 month wait, estimated!! Well the 2 Dots arrived on schedule and I enjoyed them so much, I ordered the Subwoofer with 2 Dot package, while I was waiting for the Charcoal Enhanced Smart Hub. Smart Hub came sooner than expected! Yep!! Enhanced with 2 Dots is perfect, bass quality is good. I’m satisfied 💯 If you add the subwoofer it only Enhances the Hub to another level of sound!! Totally Incredible 💯💯💯

Music streaming services could use and update. I wasn’t a fan of Amazon Music as it limited majority of songs. If you link Apple Music to Alexa it doesn’t carry over your downloaded songs so youlll have to request to listen to something specifically. And as for Spotify. Probably the best to use if wanting to stream music, however sometimes it will play songs that are not “liked” by you. (My current Spotify plan is “Spotify Free” ) so that probably why but idk

I use it as a computer speaker. At first I had it connected via Bluetooth, but after messing around in the app a bit, I discovered this awesome “secret” feature. My motivation was the fact that I got sick and tired of Alexa announcing that the computer was connected each and every time when the computer was awakened. There is a selection within the settings on the app that allows you to change the 3.5mm jack on the back from an output to an input. That was the coolest feature to me! There is a very slight delay in the audio startup, but it’s not like the  mile-long delay when connected by way of Bluetooth. I’m sure this will be sorted out after an update or two. It’s not enough to upset me, though. I want to dive further into the features that are supported by the included Zigbee hub. There’s nothing in the manual about that, though. Those were the two main reasons I bought it. The sound is just as good, if not better than, just about any computer speakers you can buy for the same money.I hope this was helpful.

Update:  I rated this 4 stars, but I'm changing it to 3 for now.  I have become increasingly frustrated with it's inability to hear me.  Sometimes I have to yell so loud that the bedroom Echo responds instead of the one in the family room.  I'm seriously considering returning this one and using my old gen 1 Echo.  Either Amazon needs to improve the sensitivity or give us the ability to adjust it ourselves.I bought this to replace a gen 1 tower.  I have several echo devices around the house and liked the old cylinder.  I won’t comment on the aesthetics since that is a personal preference, but will say the new design requires a larger footprint on the table.  The base is small, but the diameter of the sphere means you can’t put anything close to the bottom of the base.  Functionally, the sound quality is much better than the gen 1 device.  I appreciate that the new design probably was necessary for that.  The new echo is much more directional.  This is good if you have it against a wall, but not if it is in the middle of the room.  The light ring at the base makes it difficult to see on a low table or if there is something on the table next to it (like a book).  I have a lot of trouble seeing if Alexa heard me.  Speaking of that...it seems Alexa is aging and has a lot more trouble hearing me than the old one did.  I find I have to talk loudly to be heard and with the light ring at the bottom, I have to be in the right position to see if she’s responding.  The built in hub was a bonus.  I have a hub from years ago, so have not made use of it yet, but will eventually try to retire the hub I have.  I like the new device, but will not be replacing any of my gen 3 dots with the new dots.  I wish they still sold the gen 3s with the clock.  I’ll wait for the next revision and see how I feel about those.

Due to physical disabilities I live in a nursing facility.  I used to have a house with many of the previous generation Eco speakers, but now I have only this one speaker.  I spend many hours listening to music on it, and I am very satisfied with its music quality and response to verbal commands.  Everybody who comes into my room comments on how good it sounds.  Sometimes it is noisy in the hall, but it seems to filter that out and respond correctly.  I feel that the 4th generation speaker responds faster and more accurately to commands than previous generations.

Naturally I like being able to just say, ""Alexa, turn on the lights,"" or ""Alexa, set the heat (temperature) to ## degrees"" in order to accomplish these tasks. On these winter days, I especially like being able to turn up the heat from the comfort of my bed by invoking Alexa. But all this just increases my disappointment when Alexa just doesn't seem to get what I am requesting, even when I am taking great care to be very clear. Even worse is when Alexa appears to go on strike and just not respond to my requests at all. I dread hearing her frequent plaint, ""I'm sorry. I'm not understanding right now. Try again later."" In addition to these complaints, I have to add that Amazon is still far from the top of its game when it comes to the sound quality of its Echo devices--at least this one. If Amazon is going to tout ""premium sound,"" it should certainly do better. When Alexa speaks, she sounds as if her face is buried in a pillow, and music is by no means crisp, clear, or well balanced. What bass response there is does not make up for imbalances over the rest of the frequency range, which Alexa's equalizer function seems unable to adequately adjust. To sum up: Echo 4th Generation is still not ready for prime time.

My original big Alexa was getting cranky which meant I was regularly unplugging it, letting her think about her issues and reset, and plugging her back in.  Inconvenient.  So, since the sound from the new Alexa was supposed to be much better, I got it.  The sound is better.  A little bit better but not enough to make it a reason to run out and replace a non-cranky Alexa.I do like the globe rather than the tall tin can style much better.  It's much less obtrusive.Overall, I'm glad to have it but it wasn't the improvement I hoped it would be.  I do have a Bose bluetooth speaker so I don't know why it matters except that apparently I am a lazy woman.

To be honest I really just wanted a reasonably priced speaker for my living room.  I wasn’t interested in any of the Alexa features at all.The sound quality on this little thing for the price is outstanding.  Crisp, powerful bass even at low volume.Even though I wasn’t interested in the assistant features I do make frequent use of the timer, reminders, to do list  and alarms.  They all work seamlessly with my iPhone.Comparatively speaking, I was looking into getting a HomePod mini from Apple for $99.  At $30 cheaper the echo makes more sense for me because I use Spotify and Apple Homepods for some stupid reason don’t support Spotify (which if we’re being honest is the superior streaming platform in every quantifiable way).My only complaint about the echo is that is has to stay plugged in to work. It would have been absolutely perfect if this thing had a battery and you could move it around anywhere without having to consider where a power outlet was.  I see that there’s an adapted that you can purchase to gain that functionality for $40, but I’m not sure that I’d want to buy that as I suspect the 5th gen might come with that. Who knows...That aside, I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend this!

The speaker sounds good, but it’s a complete waste of money. The second I hooked this thing up to Alexa , every single echo in the entire house no longer will play more than 100 songs on an Amazon playlist. It has corrupted our entire system. I’ve been on the support multiple times these  guys have no idea what the hell he talking about with their own product.  They have you unplugging things, rebooting things , they cannot figure it out, so the only next step is to tell me is my Iphone to the point right as hang up. Even though everything in the house worked perfectly seconds before hooking up this piece of trash. The Amazon music playlist will work on every single speaker in my office, works perfectly in my car, and works perfectly on my cell phone up to to 250 songs. But the second you connect to the app echo the piece of garbage fourth or fifth generation of whatever the hell this thing is it always says the song straight back to the first song and if you go to anything over 100 songs are automatically sent it back to the first one again.  No matter what.  Amazon doesn’t give a rats ass about fixing it refunding,  it so my next step is a sledgehammer and the dumpster. Don’t waste your money on this piece of garbage.

Amazon just keeps getting better and better with these.  I bought it to replace an again Gen 2 that was having trouble with maintaining consistent volume levels and had a non functioning mute button.  This one is better at hearing (although not necessarily understanding) commands, especially for my wife.  She used to fight with Alexa pretty regularly and usually devolved into a shouting match.  There's a lot less yelling now.  This Gen 4 is also considerably louder than the Gen 2.  I usually ran the Gen 2 in my kitchen with the volume at 4 or 5 and find that much too loud.  Level 2 or 3 is more appropriate.I am not crazy about the look.  The ball seems less discrete than the cylinder but otherwise, it is a definite upgrade.

With this speaker added to my home , I'm finally able to play Spotify outside and have the same music playing in rooms throughout the house simultaneously (on the multiple Echo Shows and Echo Dots set up in rooms throughout). This speaker is NOT waterproof, so I bring it in when I'm not using it, but by attaching a simple D ring to the tripod hole in the base (https://www.amazon.com/Danger-Buddies-Camera-Carabiner-Clip/dp/B088C4Z231) I can attach a carabiner easily and hang this speaker in the yard worry-free. The sound quality is phenomenal, and guests love that whether they're in the yard or in the bathroom, the same great music is playing. Creates loud, rich sound, full enough for my small back yard, and it responds quickly to commands. Love that I can control my outdoor lights with my voice ""Alexa, turn on the string lights!"" from anywhere in -or out!- of the house. Could see this whole-house integration being a great asset during sports events too. With an Alexa enabled soundbar, you could walk away from a game on tv and still hear the audio while manning the grill in the yard. I wish Amazon would create a battery operated water resistant version of their speaker, but for this price and sound quality, I'm in love.

I have been primarily using Alexa as a speaker to listen to music with, and while it is fantastic for music, it feels like the voice options leave a little to be desired. She often misunderstands me even when I say a prompt she is expecting word for word. And unfortunately, despite weeks of effort, she cannot understand my favorite musician's name, so I always have to look for him on my phone and connect via bluetooth. I also feel like she has very limited voice utility compared to Google's assistant, which almost always understands me and can process most requests easily.

My GF had an echo and we used it so much when at her house I had to get one for my place. I got this bigger on with premium sound bc I didn't think her's had enough bass, this one has too much bass in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it sounds great but that bass, just too much at times. I wish there was a way to adjust the EQ on these things, maybe there is and haven't found it. The better than expected part is that I keep learning new things that I can do with this echo. I already have it controlling a light in my living room, that was pretty cool. I still haven't found a way to change the voice to something else, I don't think Amazon wants me to do that.I would recommend getting this larger Echo as apposed to the smaller one, I can put up with too much bass more that I can not enough.

I have a 1st generation Echo, a 2nd Gen, a Studio and now this 4th Gen. The sound quality is only surpassed by the Studio, which was twice the price and three times the size. This is also the first unit that incorporates a temperature sensor, so I can just ask Alexa for a readout from wherever I am in the house.I still prefer the 1st gen’s version of manual volume adjustment (by turning a ring on top) to that of the other three, which employ a + and - button, which is not as easy or intuitive to use in the dark, like on your nightstand. I know I can request a volume adjustment by voice, but that often results in a +/- that’s not quite what I wanted. Amazon should think about using a simple volume knob on top of the unit. This would also enable continuous adjustment, not limited to the discrete steps offered by using buttons.By placing these Echos in various rooms, I now have synchronized music or talk throughout the house, which I can control from anywhere. I also now have a couple of high end radios which are just collecting dust.

Everything about the echo dot is great. I've had only 1 problem and it was because of me. I've setup my echo and used it for awhile, soon I had to move. I unplugged it and tryed to set it up in my new house but it wasn't working, it kept saying device isnt registered and it wouldn't connect to my wifi. After months of having it and not being able to get it to work at my new house. I decided to finally write a review for the device which in return I got a call from Amazon the day after I wrote it. The women that answered was very willing to help and turns out I had 1 payment of $15 left until it was fully payed off and that is what was keeping it from working. Thank this women bc I was close to selling it. 🙏

I have a pair of 3rd generation Echos, and remember being very impressed with the sound quality when I first go them.  I also remember thinking ""Why do I care about 360 sound, unless this speaker is going to sit in the dead center of the room?""  Maybe a half-moon shape or something that projects sound at all angles against a flat surface.  The full-size Echo has good Bass, so I didn't really want that bouncing off the walls- I live in an apartment.  I was one of the first pre-orders for the newest 4th gen Echo and assumed it would arrive on or near 10/22/2020, but I later learned it would not arrive for nearly a month.  The Best Buy near me had 2 in stock, so I bought both and transferred my old Echo to the kitchen.I read some of the earliest reviews, saying the voice recognition wasn't on par with the previous model- and I think I imagined that being true at first.  It seems to detect a very soft wake word 5-10-15 feet away.Appearance wise- I like it.  When viewed from the front, it appears to be a perfect sphere.I think the biggest improvement in sound quality will be for the smaller Dot.  The previous version isn't good for much beyond a satellite auxillary speaker to round out your multi-room music playing.

Initially we loved bringing Alexa into our home. As time has passed, her own voice sounds very tinny and echo-ey. It randomly comes on, as though it is listening in on our conversations. I feel as though 9 times out of 10 that it asks us to repeat questions or requests, which it Did Not do in the first months of use. We keep it clean and have not changed anything in the home that would effect this. Thinking that it's just another electronic device that is made to self destruct so that you have to buy a new one.

The sound quality alone made this purchase worth it! I purchased a total of 3 Echo Dots in the past, I believe they were 2nd and 3rd generation. They have started to lag in response time and sometimes the wrong device would respond without being prompted and the sound quality had always been mediocre as I could barely hear the responses from 6 feet away. I decided to upgrade to this and I'm so glad I did!! I can now hear everything loud and clear and I can finally fill my house with music! It was really easy to set the new ones up thanks to already having previous devices set up. I love it!!!!

Sounds great, recognizes my voice wether I mumble or proclaim loudly. The complainants about sound quality must be from a very early batch of these that slipped through quality control, because mine is phenomenal, and it’s LOUD! I don’t have many smart devices for it to control, but I do have the smart light bulb that mine came with. You can ask it to adjust the color of the light (red blue greed gold yellow turquoise purple, etc), and also the brightness. During the day if I’m using it I tell it to “adjust the bedroom light to 100% brightness”. If I’m winding down for the night I tell it to “reduce bedroom light to 5% brightness”. Had no issues personally, so if there were any bugs, they are fixed now. Havnt experienced any and am very satisfied.

I sued to have just one dot in the bedroom. My wife sleeps best when there's music playing at night. Since the dot was on my side of the bed it had to be turned up louder for her to hear it. Yes, I know I could have moved it,  Regardless. When I saw that you could sync these and have them playing in stereo, I quickly bought two. Once they were home and set up, one on either side of the bed, the sound quality is incredible for such small speakers. Great base for our purpose and clear sound. Alexa is far more responsive and requires less volume from the person to hear and respond. I would buy these again and have replaced the dot in the living room with one as well when it was on sale..

Purchased 2 Echos to create an easy to install sound system for our 70 inch TV. I had two problems to solve; first, I have lost about half my hearing, and secondly, we were completely unable to control a full blown 5 speaker surround system  through our Fire Cube and TV despite help from several others and even the Fire experts at Amazon.The Echos were easy to install using the Alexa App on my iPhone. Once they connected to our Wi-Fi network, it took only a few minutes through the app to pair them to the Fire Cube to create a sound system. The sound is quite good considering the small size of the speakers. Perhaps not equal to high end stereo speakers, but better, and more adjustable than those in my Bose radio. I was surprised and really like the equalizer adjustments available in the app.We only use the Echos as the sound system for the TV and to listen to music once in a while - no shopping or asking questions, etc. At the sale price of $69 each, I find them to be a fair value for our needs.

I am very pleased with this generation echo. The sound is rich and responds well to voice commands. Other than music, I use for a smart bulb and a smart plug. The plug has its own WiFi network, consequently at times I need to repeat a request. I don’t believe it’s a fault of the echo. I have a dot as well. The fourth gen. Echo is a big improvement in sound. I do own a high end stereo, but this provides instant access and listening to amazons no cost music files. The four stars are simply because I’m not as tech savvy to be authoritative

There should be an easier way for Alexa to recognize my voice without me having to actually go into the app. That being said since my sister set up our first generation, her voice is still the only one this Alexa recognizes.

I have owned every echo speaker (excluding the studio and sub) and this is by far the best echo yet. Sound quality is great and having Zigbee built into the $99 dollar speaker (RIP Echo Plus) is great for my home light setup. The ONLY reason (and warning) that this Echo lost a star is when 2  of these Echos are paired as a home theater setup with a 4K fire stick or Cube the volume is horrendously low on streaming video. At max volume the echo was maybe 60-70% of what the Echo Plus setup was. Oddly music and any other skills volume is fine. I assume this is some weird issue in “surround” sound processing. Only way to make louder is to mess with EQ settings but then sound balance isn’t great. I’m positive a firmware update can fix this but extremely annoying that this is not equal to (or better) than the Echo Plus even though there is even one extra speaker in the new Echo. So for now I would say an absolute buy for non home theater setups and maybe a wait to buy if this is going to mainly be used in home theater mode. I’ll update this review if I see any change.

All my Alexa Dots, Echo Shows do not work today Dec. 7th 2021This Larger Ball Echo device - it does sound Way Better which is why I bought it for the room it is in.  However - it NEVER responds to my inquiry the first time, I always have to ask it twice before it will respond.  Ok, if i'm standing next to it... then it will listen to me.  Meanwhile, the 5 Dots i have scattered throughout my small house will start answering me from other rooms... interesting how good the mic is on those little things but not this larger Ball like device.

New echo, new shape, new sound. First off I have echoes of all generations in my home.  Sound wise this is the second best of all. The early 1 st generation Echo has surprisingly the best sound of all.  As the echo price point decreased (279$ for early 1st gen, to 69$ now) so had the sound quality. I wall mounted this about 5 feet high and it produces whole room sound. This is possibly the loudest echo. Sound quality is good. Especially at the price point. The claim to be able to pair with fire TV and use as a speaker is awesome, I have not tried to do it yet. But that is something I have wanted, no need for a speaker bar. Not 360 degree sound but directional tweeters. I’m not sure if my speakers are pointed the correct way but it sounds great on a wall mount. The claim to be able to pair with another 4th gen for stereo sound is also very interesting. All in all, this is a buy at this price point,  I’m very impressed and may replace my 2nd and 3rd generation echoes with these.

This is a large speaker, probably like two to three times as big as the smaller one of the same model. About the size of a softball, slightly larger.This does have great sound, I am use to typical echos that have mediocre sound at best. The premium sound model is by far much better than typical echos.I bought this on sale so I didn't pay full price. I am also not sure how it compares to regular bluetooth speakers like my JBL flip.I will be adding the Amazon subwoofer to go with this the next time I can catch it 50% off.

The setup was easy as it came configured to my account. Just fired up the speaker opened the Alexa app on my phone and the device was discovered right away. I have several 4th gen echo dots in the house and this device sounds much better with deeper bass and better sounding highs. My taste in music is quite varied - from loud raucous rock (think Jump Around by House of Pain) to exquisite opera (think Casta Diva sung by Renee Fleming). Both types of music sound terrific. I have a rather large family / living room and the sound fills the entire area. I purchased the wall mount and it was easy to mount and hide the power cable. The mount allows the Echo to swivel so I can point it in the direction of the listener. A neat feature of the Echo that is not available in the Echo dot is a temperature sensor. It's still calibrating the temp so I haven't tested this as yet. All in all this was a great purchase as I traded in my 3rd gen echo dot, got an additional 25% discount (plus $5)over the already 20% discounted sale price. What a great deal!

Me agrada que es un articulo cómodo, se puede colocar en cualquier lugar sin que estorbe. tuve muchos problemas para la configuración ya que la gran mayoría de aplicaciones se deben configurar en ingles y para la locación geográfica de Estados Unidos. Deben expandir su adaptabilidad para que funcione correctamente en locaciones de habla hispana u otro idioma. No se puede controlar todos los dispositivos, esperaba que tuviera mas funcionalidad con la música y el Roku para el TV, pero solo abre la aplicación y ya no hace mas nada luego debes usar tu control remoto como de costumbre. En seguridad hasta el momento le doy un cien porciento.

Shortly after installing I had a fall and due to recent surgery could not get off the floor by myself. I needed the paramedics. But as I was ready to take a shower didn't have my lifeline button on me and the phone was in other room. So I just laid there awhile. I didn't know if it would work but I told Alexa to call a name in my phone and she did and I told him I needed help. He called paramedics, let them in and they got me off the floor. Every senior should have one of these. And get the Echo vs the Dot. The Echo hears better, has better speakers. The Dot works fine but you'll have to talk louder. I was always hesitant having a microphone in the house connected to the internet so its a leap of faith its not secretly listening. But I trust Amazon and the device is useful. I'll let others describe its many uses. BTW today the moon is 316,600 miles from Earth. It changes every day. For the truly curious you'll love Alexa.

Overall, the 4th Gen with Premium Sound is definitely worth the money.  We have a few Echo Dots and one Echo Studio.  While the 4th Gen with Premium Sound is not equivalent to the Echo Studio, it is quite good.My only beef is that we purchased the Charcoal and it came with a white power cord.  Really Amazon?  You actually paired a white power cord with a charcoal unit?  Whose bright idea was that?

Of course it doesn’t always do what it is supposed to do but that is technology sometimes. My main issue is that I have started noticing a static sound when playing my music. It reminds me of when a speaker is blown or real close to it. I never turn the music up loud and I don’t use it often for music either so I’m surprised at the quality. It is not even a year old. That is just a little disappointing.

* AUDIO:  the audio coming out of this Echo is very heavy on the bass and sounds are muddled.  Not crisp, clean, clear.* BUILT-IN ZIGBEE HUB:  after unplugging the Echo (or after a power outage) Zigbee devices get disconnected and do not automatically reconnect.  It is a huge pain to have to reset and reconnect each device and redo any routines that used those devices.  I also worry about the safety and security of a smart home when devices like heaters, humidifiers, alarms, etc no longer talk to the hub or follow automated commands after after a power outage.  Hopefully this is something that Amazon can fix with a Echo software update.* TEMP SENSOR: I like that there is a temperature sensor, but unlike a standalone Zigbee temperature sensor, the temperature reading from the Echo doesn't show up when I add the Echo to the Favorites section of the Devices page in the Alexa app.  It should.  Seems fixable with an Alexa app update.* FORM FACTOR:  The spherical shape may work for smaller Echo Dots, but in the larger Echo it is not appealing.  In my room it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Reminds me of those big red bollards in front of Target stores.

I actually prefer the more balanced sound from my echo plus (2nd gen) without needing to mess with the equalizer. I also prefer the 360° sound from the echo plus. after going back-and-forth I’ve personally experienced the microphones on the echo plus pick up my voice better. in my opinion this new version just sounds a little bit louder with more bass even though they both have the exact same drivers with the exception of the new one having an extra tweeter which doesn’t really make a difference in the sound. I actually had to turn down the bass just a little because it sounded a little... messy. i’m not really sure why they completely changed the design and got rid of the 360° sound and made it a directional sound speaker instead. i’m a little confused. One more thing I noticed about the new speaker is when the volume goes up the bass goes down which is very common for all these speakers and most Bluetooth speakers but it seems especially evident in this newest version of the echo. they could’ve at least made the bluetooth option volume sync with your phone with this new version. and of course it wasn’t compatible to pair with my echo plus for stereo. ok i’m done.

This Amazon Echo arrived quickly, installed easily, and I quickly integrated it with my Fire TV 4k. However the design change was a horrible mistake. Moving from a tall cylinder shape to a shorter cylinder shape was an excellent move. Turning that into a ball was a horrible decision. First, few things are shaped that way in your house so instead of blending, it stands out. Secondly it is significantly wider, so it takes up more room, and due to its fabric covering will end up collecting way more dust on its wider top surface area. The previous model had a hard plastic top where the buttons were and was therefore easy to dust. How do you dust fabric? I have vacuum it now? Finally, the lights are now no the bottom. As most folks sit these things on tables and desks with other items, it is FAR more difficult to see the lights than when they were mounted on the top of the cylinder. Clearly, this design was not thought through. Please please go back to the prior design.  I don't need a gigantic softball on my desk.

During Prime Day 2021 I finally decided to upgrade all my echo devices. I was still rocking the gen 1 pringles can Alexa and hockey puck echo dots.Back in the day I heard about how the echo plus and then the 3rd gen still didn’t sound nearly as level or bassy as the first generation echo so I had been abstaining from upgrading for a while. But then the quality of the sound from the 4th gen had been one of the main features I had been hearing about so I finally decided it was time. And honestly on that front as well as the built in zigbee hub it delivers in spades. The 4th gen Echo is more than capable of shaking the entire bookshelf she’s on with just the default audio settings.However, there is one extremely frustrating aspect to the 4th gen echo, coming from a 1st gen: microphone quality and her ability to recognize when she is being spoken to.My 1st gen echo was almost too sensitive. She would wake up for anything that even vaguely sounded like “Alexa” at any volume with close to any amount of room noise. I have an oscillating fan in my living room and she could hear me over that and the TV. The new 4th gen will basically refuse to hear me unless I turn the fan off and mute the TV. And when she does recognize that I’m yelling ALEXA at her from 10 feet away, half the time she won’t pick up on the command I speak next. I bought a new echo dot the same day as the full size echo and she has no such problems. I honestly wish I had bought two dots except for the fact that the audio quality on the echo is outstanding.

First off, I'm not an audiophile, but I do like to listen to a lot of music.  Make that music loud, give it some bass and I'm pretty happy.  I was never quite happy with the sound quality of the  echo dot, so I put some external speakers on it, to make me happier.  I use this on my desk, so the extra space used by the pair of stereo speakers was a bit too much.  With the Echo 4th gen, I got rid of those extra speakers and have better sound quality and bass that I can feel.  Not dance party feel, but great for laying down a beat while I'm working on a PowerPoint presentation.

Firstly, I'm fully ""in"" when it comes to Amazon products. My smart home uses Alexa as a hub, fireTV products throughout, tablets, switches, plugs etc etc and not to mention various versions of Amazon Echo.With that being said I know not to expect the best of the best with anything Amazon puts out. They aren't making the top of the line product and that's perfectly fine for me.This Echo however missed the mark for me on two very important aspects sound & voice recognition. Music through this Echo is simply muffled and without substance. Yes, I've played with placement and EQ settings. It just isn't what it should be. The volume output is strong and the bass as well. There however is pitiful mid/treble range on this thing. I'd even go as far as saying my 2nd gen echo dot puts out a fuller sound than this Echo does.Additionally, the voice recognition on this system just isn't as good. I'm not sure why that is but again my earlier generation echo dots I have are more alert to my voice commands.Overall I'm disappointed. I'm no audiophile but I definitely notice the lack of quality in this speaker.

The Echo (4th generation) is a huge upgrade. Not sure why anyone would buy any previous generations as the price point and quality of these are great. So nice to have good bass, clarity, over my previous models. Now have several of these I pair so I can have music playing throughout the house.  Honestly, think the sound is comparable to the Echo Studio which is supposed to have the better sound. Sound is great for what I need.

When the echo dot (4th generation) arrived, I was very pleased with it. Sound quality was good but not nearly as good as the Echo Plus. But it filled the bill for an Alexa device with Zigbee hub. I added it to the stable of Alexa-aware devices in our home.  It was good at voice recognition and provided internet radio streaming in yet another room in the house.Then, out of the blue, it stopped working. To be precise, it answered questions about weather and time, so it was connected to the internet. But when I asked it to ""play XXX [radio station ID]"" it echoed the command and nothing happened. I tried several radio stations with the same result. Strangely enough, it obeyed commands relayed to it from the smartphone Alexa app. I tried resetting it by interrupting the power. No help there. Then, the next day, it was behaving normally again with no further intervention on my part. I have not had any such behavior on any of the other 4 Alexa-aware devices.Does anyone have an idea of what could have caused this?

I upgraded from the original Alexa.  I have trouble getting sound set to good volume and hoped it was better. IT IS NOT!

Sound quality is good. Build quality is good. Connectivity is good. Just not a fan of the interface. I don't like how I have to add apps within the app to do certain things. For example, if I want to listen to local radio stations, I have to download add ons within the app? If I'm doing this wrong please disregard what I'm saying. But half the time Alexa will not answer to some general questions I asked vs Google devices. I never had any of these little issues with Google. I was always able to get stuff answered and done with one command.

I ordered this for two reasons: one to have a louder and richer sound and second to have a 4th generation model. Sounds pretty much the same as my first generation model.

I was given the echo as a present and I put it in my room. I love music and the quality on this device is pretty great. I can even have all of my alexa devices play the same music in the house or different songs in different rooms. I also time the device to play sleep music for 20 mins at bedtime. She does all commands other Alexa devices recognize.  I would say the only downfall is that it does not have the built in clock that the echo dot has (dot is smaller and not as rich in music quality) I can ask the time but it isn't displayed. But I rather have the music quality than the clock.

I’m sure this will improve but when we ask Alexa to do something we have to repeat our request. There are times when he doesn’t understand us.

We are listened to anyway through phones etc….

This is a super handy device, but it has some reliability issues that make it iffy for the kind of lifestyle integration it seems like it'd help with. Voice recognition is a 50/50 toss-up, and while it's better at accurately recognizing words and phrases than other AI assistants, it still misses enough that important information doesn't get added to your to-do list or shopping list.I use it the most for timers, calendar reminders, task reminders, and adding things to my to-do list and shopping list hands off. Timers and task reminders work great; calendar reminders are awesome, but for some reason everything gets repeated twice even after having it set in the app to only repeat reminders once. The to-do list and shopping list feature works, but the integrations between different apps are really poor (my to-do list lets me have a dumping ground list for tasks added through the Alexa, but I have to manually sort and tag them later), and the Alexa app's features aren't strong enough that I'd be comfortable switching my lists to its platform for the ease of integration.We have two smart lights from Geeni that we use with it, and every second or third time we try to operate them through voice commands, the command fails in some way - the Echo doesn't respond even after listening to your request, or it says ""okay"" but doesn't actually operate the light until a few minutes or few tries later.We tried connecting it to our Firestick, but it was so non-functional we had a better experience just keeping them separate. HBO would routinely crash, or the sound would cut off of HBO streams, when the Echo was the speaker for the firestick; and the process of re-connecting the Echo after this happens, and clearing the Firestick app cache and relaunching things, etc. made the process miserable and unworkable.The app is very slow and hard to navigate - the paths to different features are hard to find, and you have to retrace your steps a lot to complete multiple complex actions.The audio quality is excellent, and I love using it for sleep ambience and music. However, it's very annoying to have to hear ads interfering with the experience of virtually any Alexa app you'll use, whether that's a small soundscape service or a major music platform. The best experience I have is connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play whatever I want without interruption, which is a pain, but at least then I haven't just paid for an Amazon product that still makes me listen to ads.Also, the fact that staff will have to listen to voice recordings to improve the quality of the products or that your speech is stored in the cloud at all is a huge privacy issue.

Voice recognition has never been a problem for me. However, Alexa occasionally misses my question altogether and comes back with results I was not seeking. Most of the time it's spot-on though.

I currently own the first echo dot and just purchased this beast of a sound system.  I like to wait a few years for technology upgrades and this is exactly why.  Sound couldn't be better, miss the 360 sound of the earlier model but this new one is so loud it doesn't even matter.  Now speaking to it I feel is worst then my echo dot 1.  With volume up it is damn near impossible and volume down I get in front of it and yell commands.  It aggravates me to no end but luckily I use mine for music and my ring doorbell/flood light notifications so really don't have to talk to it much.  As you will see in other reviews it comes with a terrible white power cord.  I will go to my grave never understanding that and was hoping I could use my black one from my old one to swap but it's aux cord so no go.  Again love the quality of the sound and that is pretty much all I use it for so good buy.

 Owning an Echo is completely not in my list as I was in Amazon to check out a Carhartt tee deal. A click on the ad and the rest is history. 😅.Did some study in it and with the deal, I though, why not? Took a while to reach me as I reside in Malaysia.Upon receiving it, I notice many things are geological restricted. I am frustrated indeed. My main reason of having it linked to Spotify and play it in my room is dashed. Googled a bit and manage to sneak my way through. Eureka, Spotify in my room.The sound quality is impressive for its size. You can feel the bass but on loud, sound could be muddy. Clarity isn’t the strength of this device.I’ve yet to try on other functions and hopefully, it’s not as restricted as I think it will be.With the price I paid and the device I get, I would say it’s worthy. Need to stop browsing Amazon as this place is devilish!

Hmm I honestly don't have many good things to say about the product compared to the last gen eco, which is what this review will be about.So, now when I asked Alexa to tell me the temperature inside, it tell me the temperature from it's internal temperature sensor, rather than telling me the temperature from my smart thermostat, like the last gen Eco did....for some reason..It understands me less often the last gen EcoIt is less esthetic pleasing in my opinionIt doesn't sound any better, to my ears, with any music then the last gen EcoMy conclusion, if you already have the 3rd gen Eco, I reccomend not upgrading unless your 3rd gen is fault in some way. The 4th gen Eco is a fine product and is infinitlybetter than nothing, and still far superior to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen Eco Dots.

Purchased 2 to replace Generation 1 Amazons that stopped working. These are used for controlling smart devices (plugs and lights), Music, as a timer, and general information acquisition.  It does help my GrammaPat with cooking who uses it for timers and music when cooking. I will agree with others that the voice recognition is not as good as a Gen 4 should be.  I (we) have to repeat myself and/or yell if the music volume is too high.  I disagree with the others who say they don't like the sound.  I think (assuming you do mess with equalizer)  that you can find sound that is superior to the previous generation Amazon Speakers.  I also have a Sonos 1 and I think this speaker sounds as good as that one.  I do like the built in Zigbee Hub that allows me to control more smart devices. Every now and again the speaker groups/pairings get flubbed but cycling the power fixes that. Overall I am pleased.  The price on sale at $69 is a good deal in my opinion for what you get.

Do not buy this if you are using it with Apple Music. I'm confident it's a piece of garbage for Spotify users too. Echo is advertised to work with Apple Music. But you can only use Apple Music in specific ways.You cannot access your library! The only way to access songs in your library is by creating your own playlist. And that still does not give you access to a play a song in that playlist. You have to skip through the playlist to find the desired song. It doesn't let you play Recently Played or Recently Added either.You cannot tell Echo to play a song or an album you want to listen to! You cannot select songs or albums on your phone either. The app is bad in other ways. I wish I could just connect to bluetooth and use the Apple Music or Spotify app on my phone (like any other bluetooth speaker).DELAY is very long when using the app! Earlier today I pressed the skip button on my phone to change songs. I was able to have a short conversation with someone before the command was processed (or the song actually changed). No exaggeration. Usually the delay is shorter, but still about 5 seconds. That's still unacceptable and frustrating. You cannot skip songs without wasting lots of time.You can only tell Alexa to start the playlist, shuffle, and skip songs (waiting several seconds or sometimes minutes between songs).Volume buttons on my iPhone do not work while using Echo. I have to scroll the volume tab on the app, or use my voice to tell Alexa to quiet down. And, like switching songs, there is a LONG DELAY when you adjust volume! I found myself accidentally playing music way too loud and having to just deal with the pain and discomfort for several seconds. You cannot quickly adjust the volume!I have not been this disappointed and frustrated with a product. I am convinced this is Amazon's way of making people switch from Apple Music or Spotify to their music service. It probably works well with their streaming service. That must be why Echo is priced reasonably.Sound quality is ok for the price. It's louder than I expected. However, bass heavy music like Rap sounds distorted and generally poor. It is advertised as having ""deep bass."" Bass is really disappointing with this, even considering it's a small and affordable speaker. My smaller, lighter, wireless JBL speaker has more bass. The Echo gets much louder (with no bass).Alexa is sometimes bad at understanding commands. I said earlier, ""Alexa, play Recently Played playlist on Apple Music."" (I know this command cannot be done with the Echo.) However, instead of telling me this cannot be done, Alexa played some Apple Curated playlist that had nothing to do with my command. Music played that I don't like and I could not pause it for 5-10 seconds.All that being said, you'll be disappointed with this product. Disappointed is not a strong enough word through. This thing is intentionally designed by Amazon to frustrate people that use Apple Music and Spotify. I understand that Amazon is motivated by profit. However, profit should not come at the expense of making customers angry. This Echo was clearly built to make people so frustrated, so they switch to Amazon's music service. The majority of people use Apple Music and Spotify. They intentionally prohibit the most BASIC features so that you pay them instead of Apple or Spotify! I feel disrespected by Amazon.

Generation 4 Echo has very good musical and general sound improvement as compared with Generation 2 Echo.In our experience, Generation 4 Echo Microphones seem to have more difficulty picking up voice commands in the same exact locations perviously occupied by Generation 2 Echos.  Occasionally it takes 2-3 attempts to get 4th Gen Echos to respond as compared to Gen 2 Echo units.  We purchased three new Gen 4 Echo units and they all exhibit the same characteristic.

This is a great improvement from the last generation Echo! The sound is great, Alexa is quick and responsive and I love that she is bilingual. I will say that pairing it with other Echos to create a studio sound system is confusing and to get them to work is a head ache and sometimes embarrassing in front of guests. I remember I once asked Alexa to play next song and she ignored me. I asked Alexa to turn off  and she wouldn’t turn off. I got to a point where I needed to disconnect her from the plug. Not good !! I hope & i’m sure this is  just a software problem that can be fixed later.

My biggest and pretty much only complaint with Alexa devices is me having to repeat myself when giving commands either because it did not wake when i said the keyword or it got what i said wrong. It's mostly an issue when there is background noise such as the TV playing but it could use some improvement even when there is not background noise. The ONLY reason i bought this device is because an Amazon employee told me that there were improvements to the microphones in this device compared to the Echo Dot 3rd generation but I am questioning whether that is trued because I see absolutely zero improvement.Update 10.29.2020: Now that I've had this for a week or two I've determined that the microphones are actually even worse than they were on my echo dot 3rd gen. I will be returning this product and going back to using my echo dot 3rd gen.I know most people would not be buying this device for the same reason I did and would be getting it for the better speakers or the smart hub functionality but just in case there was anyone out there wondering if the microphones/voice recognition was any better on this device the answer would be no.

Got Amazon Echo as a gift.  Never expected to enjoy it so much.  With Amazon Music, Alexa has access to almost every song ever recorded.  I love she will play Billboard's top hits from any date in history.  Want to hear the tops songs from February 1, 1972?  Alexa plays them in order off Billboard's Hot 100.  The sound quality is outstanding. It's like having a juke box (for those who remember juke boxes) with immediate access to every genre of music imaginable and the highest quality sound.  Every true music lover needs Alexa; she and Amazon Music are a great combo!

This is a big step up from the echo dot. The new echo sounds really good. Has a nice smooth sound to it that isnt harsh or overly bassy. Just perfect for background music at up to moderate levels. The built in thermometer is also a nice bonus. And fairly accurate.I did have some issues initially during setup, and it took a few tries and reboots to get wifi paired. Then spotify connect stopped working. I was ready to send it back, then firmware updated itself, and all seems well now. Lesson learned, i should have initiated a firmware update right off the bat.All in all its a nice upgrade from my 3rd gen dot, and the spherical design that initially put me off, seems to blend in nicely.One thing I would like to see changed: the light ring. It looks great, but as you increase volume, the light changes from right to left (clockwise), which if you are looking at the front of the echo, is the opposite of what you would expect.

Initially we had to get used to the color but now we like it.  At times the voice command system is balky but we are generally able to work it out.  It is disconcerting to have it listen and record what we say, but when we're not using it, we unplug it.

I bought this because of the temperature sensor.The first one I received was constantly reading wrong by a few degrees, but was inconsistent - sometimes it was correct, sometimes it was high by as many as 6 degrees Fahrenheit, sometimes it was low by a degree or two.  I know this both by the feel of the room temperature and because I placed a digital thermometer six inches from the device.  Because of this inconsistency, I couldn't even just manually include an offset for my purposes (a window AC unit plugged into an IoT plug with automations to turn it on/off based on the temperature reading off the sensor).Thinking the first one was just a defective unit, I was sent a replacement... which has the exact same issue.  Clearly the sensor in this generation is just flawed and therefore should not be purchased if you plan to use the temperature readings for anything other than a very rough estimate.Everything else about the device works as-expected and it is a very cool looking unit.If I hadn't bought this specifically for the temperature sensor, I'd probably have given it four stars.  Will update this review if the readings are fixed via software update (although I image they are due to hardware issues).

I have about a dozen different Alexa speakers. My family uses them for all kids of things in our home. We are probably their target user. Unfortunately this is the 3rd echo that has stopped working for us (1st gen echo, and two 4th gen echos). I can’t get it to connect to wifi anymore. I’ve been through the tech support route at Amazon and we’ve tried all the standard steps. I happen to think that this all started with the latest software release to extend my echo as a eero mesh router.

We had the original Amazon Echo and this one is a major upgrade in every way. First of all, the sound is much clearer and the design is much better. Instead of the cylindrical design, the spherical one helps push sound out in all directions. The microphone disabling is a nice feature with the ring light at the bottom letting you know whether or not Alexa will pick up your voice. As for the volume, it doesn't distort as much at higher volumes but there is still some if you go towards the maximum. Regarding voice recognition, it does much better at picking up my voice when playing Jeopardy! and trying to answer questions instead of constantly asking me to answer in the form of a question like who is or what is, which keeps the game flow going much smoother. This version is definitely faster to answer questions as well with upgraded components. There's an aux in for directly connecting media devices to it that don't have Alexa compatibility via apps or if you want a better audio signal sent to the Echo device. Overall, it's a major upgrade that I like a lot.

This kicks ButtAt full volume no distortion.. however.. like all good speakers the bass cuts down a touch.. But who in their rite mind would listen that loud!. I mean this thing rocks!!  I have the two studios and the sub in living room.. but to get a hell of a serious stereo system..In another room. All I would need is another echo and another sub for the projector over bed.. And group together.. Oh wow!! 😂 And I got this on sale for Prime day... Wish I purchased another one... You bet I'll be looking. Target and Amazon.. Who ever has on sale again... Lol  If not loud enough for ya.. I recommend going to doctor and request hearing aids!! 😂 And run the echo sub in a corner.. And hold on to your seat after you tell alexa to play all in your speaker group room. That would be the crazy awesome to play both rooms at same time to rock the house/block.

I purchased this to control my smart home devices as the wink starting subscription fee.  I hope this can be a replacement of my wink hub, but I was wrong.The sound quality is good , better than my first gen of echo.The response time is much slower, my Echo 1st gen and other echo dots device response immediately ,but this new echo takes 3-5 seconds to response. I reset it multiple times , after reset , it works fine , after a while it slows down.It does not support any z-wave devices, that is expected. so  I still need a z-wave hub to work with my z-wave devices.It can connect my GE link A19 bulbs and Philip hue bulbs , but it frequently lost connection to my bulb in bed room , while my new echo is in living room. it has no problem at all for the wink hub, but the echo hub has distance limitation.Using the Alexa to manage my device is not user friendly as wink . expecting a lot of  improvement for this device.

The sound is VERY good on this. Is it a high end speaker? No. Is it better than the 2nd generation that's been collecting dust for X amount of years that it replaced? Definitely. This gives music a much richer sound that previous models can't compare to. The best feature IMHO is the addition of smart home integration directly into the hardware. I have quite a few older pieces of equipment that connect through an aging smarthome bridge that gives me trouble if the power is out for too long. I am slowly removing their connections fromt he bridge and over to the Echo and love that it can handle it.

I have to repeat commands very often. So is the microphone bad?The circling light in the Echo interferes with sleep. Echo software does not provide a ""switch off"" all lights feature.

I bought two Echo Dots and One Echo.  The Echo Dots outperform the Echo on responding to voice commands.  I can be 25 feet from an Echo Dot and it never misses a command.  Can be 2 feet from the Echo and get the response “I don’t understand that.”  The unfortunate part is that this Echo seems to not understand on a regular basis.  Had it check for updates and responded up to date.  Redid voice training and no real change.30 July 2021.  Update, I decided to try “ Whisper Mode” so I could whisper and Alexa would whisper.  What I found was, whisper mode improved the hearing ability of the Echo so much in fact, I can now speak in a normal voice 25 feet away and Alexa responds appropriately.  Upgraded to 4 stars from two.

I upgraded My 1st Gen. Alexia on a whim; it was when I read that I could do a trade in that I made the jump. I've been happy with the one that I had.The newer model has, for me at least, better sound in addition to the smaller foot print; I'd have preferred a black power cord rather than the white one that came with the black Alexia; but I can learn how to live with it.What I've noticed however is that my voice commands, e.g.,""Alexia Off"" ""Alexia  set alarm"" have to be said in a louder than normal voice;  from a distance of six feet. This was not a problem with the older model. Even after checking the settings on my phone app. the problem is still there. It's not a deal breaker, but it is more of an annoyance than is needed.Is it worth the hassle? Overall, yes.Having Samuel L. Jackson tell you a joke or give you a temperature check is also worth it.

I have two of this generation Echo, and while I like almost everything about them, this one has an inaccurate temperature sensor when it gets below 50 degrees.

So I’m disappointed in the performance for my purpose. Aside from that it works great.

For the most part I'm pretty happy with it but it does occasionally hiccup. Needing to be rebooted. Turning on the TV randomly at 2am. Not being able to program several things to happen when you say ""Goodnight"" (yeah, they say you can do this but you run head long into limitations). There's so much to learn about the limitations of various devices and how they talk to each other and none of that info is in one place. Well, Alexa, play lullaby,  Alexa set sleep timer for 30 minutes.

I bought three of these around the release and have regretted the purchase. We have a total of 12 Echos, Echo Shows, & Echo Dots placed throughout our home and these are the worst when it comes to communication. 2 of them replaced Echo 3rd Gens, and another was an add on to an existing TV (with 4k firestick) for better sound and since adding them to our system, we have had nothing but problems with the wrong device answering us. None of the locations changed, these were just swapped in. We noticed that these ALL LAG, and must not have the same speaker configuration as the Echo 3rd Gens because Echos two rooms away will now answer before these devices will.They do sound GREAT when they work properly, but because we already had a functioning system throughout our house, and knew the capabilities, these were/are a HUGE let down.I have tried updating them to see if that helps, but it has not.As a stand alone device these might be great, but to a family that has been using Alexas since the beginning and keeps adding for functionality around the home, we find them more of a nuisance than a help. We end up yelling at poor Alexa more than it's worth.I will note also, one is being used and is hard wired into my work from home computer, and that one lags even more... I notice when I unplug the AUX cable it seems to pick up speed, but when it is plugged in via the AUX cable to my PC it lags and is very slow to respond which in turn has the wrong device answering most times.It has all become more frustrating than helpful. Hoping that an update can help solve this matter in the future.

We really are getting to like the Alexa service and particularly how good this unit sounds. The only problem is that we get offers for things like a smart outlet that it is supposed to control but when you get the plug, you find out that the Echo can't actually discover it and you need another app on another phone or tablet to actually make it work. Which means unless that phone or tablet is near or turned on with that app running, the Echo can't actually control the smart devices.

One has to bend to see if the ring color is blue at all or any color. It's not very clear.

If you just need someone to talk to, the Echo is perfect for you. If you want a device that will actually do what it is supposed to without randomly just forgetting how to do things it was doing literally minutes before, don't waste your money on an Echo.I purchased the Echo to act as a room thermometer since I live in a state that does not feel that central heat and air is worth providing to peasants in apartments. Worked great out of the box, so I got a bunch of the light bulbs to go with it expecting that I was about to start setting up my smart home for the future. Within a few days most of the light blubs no longer responded to voice commands, or did respond but Alexa would tell me that it is not responding. Annoying, but as it was not the thing I bought this for, it was simply an annoyance.Then the thermometer stopped working. Rather than tell me there is an issue, or provide any semblance of help, Alexa just says this feature is not supported. Well, that of course is simply not correct, but Alexa will not help you with things, she simply is a robot voice with no ability to problem solve or even perform the most basic error checking that even Windows is finally good at. So there is no arguing with her, when she says it is not supported, boom, it simply does not work anymore.So I went through the hassle of trying to figure out how to get it working again. Finally found that by removing all of the groups and lights I had added and then reset the device, the one thing I bought it for will actually work again. Great! I cant use any of the other features it has or it will kill the thermometer, but hey $50 for a thermometer is a steal. Wait... indoor thermometers are way cheaper than that. Well shoot.I then got home this evening to find that even though I have none of the other features activated, the thermometer is again ""not supported"". I work in tech support so I understand that things will not always work right out of the box, and that is reasonable. For them to randomly break with no input from the user is just a sign of a poorly made and designed product. Honestly, Bezos has all of the money now so trying to provide feedback to Amazon at this point is useless. If you have never gotten to experience their customer service, try it sometime. It is eye opening. So rather than write them a long message they will never read, it is easier to just let all of yall know what to expect.It might work, it might not, but if it doesn't you are up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Quite honestly mine is a paperweight right now. At least it cant mess that up. Not happy, 0/10 would not recommend.

I upgraded to an echo 4 gen from an echo 2 gen and finding the 4 doesn't seem to hear me as well as the 2. Sometimes I have to repeat myself. Sometimes I'll give a command to turn on the bedroom light and it turns on the dining room light instead which is puzzling as they don't sound similar. The bass is good but music doesn't sound much better than the 2.  It's not overwhelming. I may end up resetting the 2 back up.

Updated 3x: this device works for a while then will randomly stop listening to you and you need to manually restart them to get it to listen to you. This makes it feel more like a diy tinkering toy and less like a premium product.My device still plays music from routines so I know it is connected to the internet so this is just an Amazon issue. Very disappointing. I wish I had stuck with google or tried apple’s offering instead.Another issue I’ve found, this device consistently asks me if I want to hear about products. I want my smart home device to control my smart home, not shove marketing down my throat.Updated 2x: the device has not given me any more issues. The mic is so sensitive it hears commands coming from downstairs or even when I whisper the A word. The sound quality is muddy but becomes “normal” when you turn down the bass setting as low as possible. This makes the device sound very good. This is a great upgrade over a dot to the point where I actually enjoy listening to music on it.If you want an alexa device and don’t want to spend $200 for the studio this is the one to get.I only wish they added that light up clock on this one, then It would be perfect for me.Updated: last time I unplugged and plugged back in this device seemed to do the trick fixing the microphone sensitivity for the last week.We will see how long it lasts before I need to do this againI needed to upgrade because the echo 1 I was using had an issue where the speaker would short out so you had to unplug it and plug it back in to get the sound to work.In terms of sound and voice recognition this device is not a huge upgrade compared to the first gen echo.This device is just as good as the original with some added features like a thermometer and sonic detection and a 3.5mm out/in so you can use it as a speaker or use other speakers with it.Why this device gets 1 star is for some reason when the device has been plugged in for awhile it will stop hearing the wake word. I am unsure if it is a power saving setting or a wifi setting but the device just does not listen. The only way to fix it is to unplug and plug the device back in.This was the main reason I needed a new device in the first place so you can see how satisfied I am with the new echo.Will update the review if they fix it, until then I’ll keep using my google home mini instead

I have been a long time user of Amazon Echo devices but I am done.  They no longer stay connected to my network.  I can see the devices disconnecting over and over again from the network in my routers system log.  And the latest problem is they will only play one song at a time from Apple Music but will play songs all day long from Amazon Music.  I am just tied of the problems ... one big headache!!!  Time to get either a real speaker from Apple or Google!Update: Amazon Technical Support contacted me via email and told me to update the devices to the latest version of the firmware.  Yes, on the Echo 4th Gen you can say ""Check for Updates"" and it will tell you all updates have been applied.  So ... why does it only play Amazon Music?The update option does not apply to Echo Show 5.  Not by saying ""Check for Updates"", not by using the screen and navigating to Settings even though it tells you navigate to Settings to apply updates.  Yes, it tells you to navigate to Settings and apply updates.  There is no option under Settings to do this.  And yes I have used the app to try and do the same thing and the option does not exist even though Amazon documentation tells you it does.  How can anyone honestly give this Echo or Echo Show devices anything above 1 star?

We have had the smaller echo dots throughout our house to make announcements a d play music as well as smart home features. I wanted to find a better sounding alternative to the dot and I wanted to pair them in to stereo speakers. I was a bit worried about how these would sound and even considered doing apples HomePod instead. However, I really didn’t want to mix smart speakers in the house.That being said, I ordered these premium sound Echo’s. I have not at all been disappointed. In fact I was pleasantly surprised!! The sound is really amazing with good bass and clear mid and hi fidelity. It was exactly what I was hoping. Again, I have paired these two so that when music is played they both play the music, one as left channel and the other as right.The only disappointing thing to me was I was hoping to pair these to work with my Apple TV for movie watching but it doesn’t work in the ‘stereo’ mode with Bluetooth. It only plays on of them Echo’s not both.

I was on the fence about getting the ""new"" 4th generation Echo, since I already had the ""old"" 4th generation.  I thought it was too expensive for what seemed to me to be just a feature upgrade.  Boy was I wrong.  first of all the new version is two or three times the size of the old one, and second of all, the sound quality will blow you away.  It resembles surround sound.  It could be used as a ""sound bar"" for your TV!

Great sound quality, good price, love the convenience of Alexa however I’ve noticed when using my toaster or microwave while the echo was plugged in, my dog reacted erratically, trembling and panting uncontrollably. My fearless 50lb Pit Bull became so afraid that she’d hide behind my legs or behind the couch and was totally inconsolable. (Picture the behavior some dogs experience during thunderstorms) It took me about a week to figure out what was causing this once I realized there was a pattern. I researched my concern and found many other pet owners who experienced the same or similar thing with their pets after buying the echo...It seems there is a high frequency sound being emitted that only dogs can hear. I was going to return my device but once I realized the problem stopped after unplugging it, I decided to move it away from the kitchen into the living room to give it one more shot. The problem is gone now. Unfortunately, it was so traumatic to my dog that she still runs out of the kitchen every time I turn the toaster on :(

I have very basic home automations and zigbee devices that I wanted to run under a single hub. The Echo is good at the basics (turn lights on/off at X time) and makes a good stepping stone for beginners because once you advance to needing a true smart home hub, you will still want the Echo around to manage voice controls so it doesn't necessarily become obsolete in your home. I think this is pretty clear, but to reiterate: the hub is only zigbee compatible, not z-wave. The quality of the speaker is on par or a bit better than my Bose Sound Link Color (and is way better sounding than the Echo Dot) and easily connects with my iPhone to play music so again - good middle of the road option. The Echo seems to accomplish the smart home hub and speaker tasks very well for this price point (I purchased on sale for $70). If you are not interested in the smart home hub or the upgraded speaker, go with the Echo dot - the voice assistant features are identical.

I am sure one day you won't be able to live without her.In a word pretty amazing.

I picked up the ""premium sound"" version on sale for a couple reasons: 1) I wanted a decent speaker for my office and 2) I wanted to make the house a little ""smarter"" and there seems to be great integration with Alexa on so many devices.  I was surprised, in a good way, with the weight of this Echo.  It's got some heft to it and I almost dropped it getting it out of the box.  I chose the charcoal color and it blends very nicely on my cherry credenza.  It was very easy to set up and I was requesting Alexa to play classic rock within a couple minutes of powering it on.  The controls are easily accessible and are subtle enough that they don't distract from the overall look.  I ended up buying two of the smaller version Echo's to place around the house but would not hesitate buying another ""premium sound"" version next time I see them on sale.  This particular one was bundled with two Philips Hue bulbs and that certainly helped sway my decision to buy it!

TLDR: Its alright. Good for most people, was expecting a bit better audio.Review:I honestly expected the speaker to sound louder/better based on what people were saying. Although it is good audio for its size and price. I was expecting a little more, but that may just be my fault. It's also smaller than I was expecting. Really curious how much smaller the dot version is.The echo 4th gen does sound nice overall and is probably good enough for most people.Voice recognition works well.Zigbee works well enough for the limited amount of smart home devices i have.Setup was a little weird because it didn't recognize during set up the first time, but I just exited the app and restarted setup process and it worked fine the 2nd time without issues.I'd recommend this for those who are getting their first smart home device like I was, especially if it's on sale. Just dont expect audio to be as amazing as some might say, although good, maybe some people were exaggerating a bit.

It's fine for simple tasks. Unfortunately, Tutorials are horrible. Alexa is a tool just as a hammer or a saw would be and one should not have to build the tool to drive a nail or cut a piece of wood. In all the years that I have been involved with technology, the one thing that programmers and developers always screw up on is that they dont think of their device simply as a tool. Big Mistake.

I was realy impressed with the audio quality. The bass is so strong, specialy nice when you connect it to your TV. I use it for listenning to music and as a home theater for the TV, they work great.

This one is worse for voice recognition for women. Its fine for men... however, i have had issues trying to integrate Spotify and smart bulbs. Neither are easy and neither work consistently. There are still the same annoying bugs... When you ask a question it answers at the last volume used and you cant hear it so you have to yell to turn it up and than ask again because it was too low. I attempted to change the command in the app but I was not able to. If you ask a question of Alexa you should receive the answer at a volume 4 or 5 so that you can HEAR it. Still have issues with not receiving reminders and timers turning off without notification.

I thought it was capable of doing more than what it does but controlling your lights and things like that it works well but I had trouble syncing it to my Kwikset cable device on my door though.

I bought this product after experiencing the performance of the ""smaller"" Alexa dot that my son owns. While this little speaker system has decent sound, I wanted it the best one.So I ordered this blue Alexa dot with the added twitters for better base sound. To my surprise it is almost double the size of my son's one (I honestly didn't notice in the photo where it is shown next to a normal coffee cup). The sounds is great and holds great quality while playing it loud. After a while, I didn't mind the fact that it was way bigger than the original version.I rated ""voice recognition"" as 3 stars due to the fact that there's a lot of surrounding noice in my house so sometimes alexa doesn't ""hear"" the commands or takes a while to respond. Could be my internet that it's not top of the line fast (?) No sure...Overall, I love it, great sound for a nice looking speaker that comparable to a BOSE is a lot more affordable.

First thing that must be noted is the size of this device. The size of the 4th Generation is about the size of a ""baseball"" the size of the 4th Generation with premium sound is the size of a ""cannonball"" so much larger.The sound quality is even more impressive than every Echo device I've ever owned to date, and I have owned every Echo Dot from 2nd Gen up.I accidentally played music on the 4th Gen w/premium sound and the concrete walls in my living room SHOOK!The bass is full and rich and the voice recognition seems to be better. My one complaint with the 4th Gen is the device either fails to respond or not responding correctly. I seem to have less issues with that with the larger 4th Gen with premium sound.Also I've had no integration issues with any of my 4th Gen devices.I'm actually considering upgrading my other two 4th Gen with the larger Echo 4th Gen device.

Sound is good but the mic is worse than the echo DOT 3rd gen. My 3rd gen dot picks up my voice in the other room while sometimes the Echo 4th gen doesn’t. I’m guessing it’s something about where the microphone is placed inside the echo.

Probably the best decision I could have made was to start organizing my life. And what's a better way of doing that than just saying I need ""x"" and being added to a list. Voice recognition clarity as well as tone of the speakers themselves it's absolutely excellent. If I had one criticism it is the internet integration. If asked a simple question such as ""what is the weather"" I get a straightforward answer. But if I ask a question such as ""what goes with turkey"" I get a recipe for turkey and not side, appetizer, wine, dessert or other suggestions.  Guessing questions like that are more suitable for a Google internet search then for this machine.  All in all a good buy.

My 1st generation Echo from 2015 was acting up so I upgraded to the newer Echo version. It was easy to hook up and install. I like the more stylish design. The only thing I miss and have to get use to is the ring color being on the bottom of the device. If I was standing away from the old echo I could see if I had a notification but with the new one I have to be much closer to the device to see any ring color. Other than that I’m happy with my Echo.

Didn't know I needed an Alexa in my life until now. Audio is perfect with the option to mess in its sound settings. Voice recognition on point, can pick my voice up from across the room. Only issue was the Bluetooth. Initially when pairing with your Philips Hue bulbs it would work but once you move them, Alexa stops detecting them. I tried resetting the bulb with its code but that didn't work though the bulb flickered for a second. To fix the issue I had to reset Alexa back to set up mode and pair the light bulbs again by resetting it with its code. Another issue was that sometimes Alexa would not play the audio from my laptop though it was connected. When I try to disconnect or forget my laptop device on the Alexa app it would give me errors or won't disconnect/ forget. Just unplug Alexa and replug, head to the Alexa app and try disconnecting or forgetting the device again. Overall a great product that I'm not using at the full potential just yet.

Amazon changed the appearance of the Echo with the 4th generation, but the sound quality increased dramatically. The bass is heavier in this unit than in previous versions which is a welcome change. The sound is crisp enough to fill a small room. It still won't replace high-end audiophile systems, but this is a step in the right direction.No longer do you need to invest in the Echo Plus to get the premium features of a Zigbee hub and built-in thermometer. These are now standard in the fourth-gen Echo.Because of the shape, Amazon has been forced to put the lighting at the bottom of the device so this may influence the decision on where to place it. The major flaw in the aesthetics is the white power cable that comes with the charcoal version of the Echo. I'm not sure if that's a fluke or if Amazon is following in the missteps of Samsung and making the colors different on purpose. This may also weigh in on the placement of the new Echo.Overall, this is a wonderfully improved Echo device despite some of the awkward appearance issues.

We live in a typical Ohio house ... main floor, second floor with bedrooms, third floor guest room, and a basement ... ours is half finished. That's a lot of house, especially for two people. So we use our Echos (plural) everywhere. Two on the second floor, three on the main floor, one in the guest room, and one down in the finished basement. When the one in the kitchen (a dot) proved to be inadequate, we replaced it with this one. Much better because that and the one in the bedroom are used most frequently. What for? Alexa, announce! Alex, set a timer! Alexa, who is xxx? Alexa, what's the weather? Alexa, wake me! Alexa, play xxxx. I even have her say ""you're welcome"" to my ""thank you."" (My mother taught me to be polite.) But it's the ""Alexa, announce"" that has proved most important. My husband and I have a need to communicate, and neither of us likes shouting.

 We have purchased almost every single Amazon echo/dot product except for the third generation echo. We finally broke down and dropped $70 for the 4th generation echo and couldn't be more pleased. We appreciate the sphere design, the white power cord and decision to place the light on the bottom.  Also the raised control buttons on top are a nice addition.By placing the device up high and unobstructed, we have not experienced any problems with the sound or the microphone hearing our commands. For the price, we have no complaints about the sound quality. It is plenty loud and has more bass than previous echos.  It should satisfy most folks.However, if you are an audiophile, keep moving cause there is nothing to see here. You will not be satisfied with the clarity. It is not as clear as a Bose or Sonos speaker system but it is also way below their price range.If you want a quality smart speaker for playing music in the background or while hanging out, grab one while on sale.

I have a prime membership so I can play prime music on this echo.

I replaced my older Amazon devices (Echo 1st gen, FireTV 1st gen and a HD Tablet) with the newer versions of the same taking advantage of the trade-in. This Echo has one major issue; it disconnects (or fall asleep) every single day and is essentially never ready to play music when I need it. It sits 12ft from my router which provides wifi 6 in the entire house. ""Unavailable for listening on"" shows up on Spotify, always. I have to ""wake up"" the device with Alexa app and THEN go back to Spotify to play music on it. I'm guessing AMZ has changed the protocol and forgot to tell Spotify so backward compatibility is broken. Never had any problem with Echo Dot or the Original Echo.

A simple instruction to play a particular song turned into a nightmare...I just want it to play the song I ask without any shuffling, ads or comments..just play the damn song and shut up. Who ever thought this update was a great idea should be fired on the spot.I was able to use this as a extender, but you have to really move it at least 20ft from your router. If its close it will just say your router has excellent range no need to use Echo as extender.

All 14 of my children love echo she puts them to bed on time, has a chore chart for the whole month, alarms for each class to change over, recognize each child voice, & most importantly keeps track of who's turn it is for the video game prevents arguing. She is my nanny when I'm away at work, store, or just at the neighbors house and the kids never have to leave or pick up there phones to call me. Just say alexa drop in on dad and she calls me right away directly to my phone no extra charges as long as she is connected to your wifi network she will do it all. My personal favorite is when i leave my house she activate guard house mood and send me frequent noises in or around the house and also can send you grocery list of what to get when your location pops up towards a food market. My wife just thinks i never forget anything but little does she knows alexa has my back, well our backs, The Lewis Family backs!

Bought this for 2 primary reasons:1st - audio, which is quite good for the size especially the bass, and FYI this is much larger than the previous round one.2nd - the built in temperature sensor, which turns out to be practically useless. I had pretty much no luck, even with support help, getting any Alexa Routines to utilize the built in temperature sensor, even though is recognized the sensor while creating the Routine. It also seems to go in to calibration mode often, and if you ask it the inside temperature it often tells you it’s calibrating ask later.I purchased an inexpensive stand alone temperature and humidity sensor and it works flawlessly with the Smart Life app to control a smart plug according to specific temperature conditions. I had no luck getting the Smart Life app to recognize the Echo temperature sensor at all, which may or may not be normal.As others state the voice recognition could be better, especially when playing music.

I made a mistake buying a smaller version and returning it - was hesitant to get this....but it's perfect!The size, the sound, the volume, is so better!I am happy owner of the three echo dot's (3rd generation) - and those are awesome products - they're small, have a great sound quality, and they're so loud. When the 4th generation came out I got the $49.99 smaller version and it was so bad in every way. It was small, even though I wasn't looking for a big speaker I was not happy to realize its so small, but the main disappointment was flat/mono sound that couldn't be fixed by sound settings and I had to return it.This speaker is 2x larger than a smaller version, but not too large, the sound quality is Dolby and you can hear the difference...and it's so loud! The sound perfectly aligns with 3rd generation echo dots when I play music on 'party time' so I have main alexa (4th) and secondary (3rd gen). It's awesome!

We bought the new Echo to replace an old hockey puck style Echo Dot that we had on the back patio.  For the old one, to get good sound we had it connected to a sound bar which is also connected to a TV we have on the patio wall.  The new Echo has a great look, in my opinion, and we bought a swivel wall mount and mounted it on the patio wall near an outlet and it works great.  The speakers are much better than the old Echo so we don't have to have it connected to the sound bar.  The sound is really good coming from the unit itself.We have lots of things that we control via our Echo devices - lights, roller shades, water fountain, robot vacuum, TV, etc., and as soon as I added this new Echo to the devices via the Alexa app it was seamless.  Everything works as it should.  We love it and are very happy with the purchase.

Easy to set up, great sound, fun to use, but who in the world came up with the idea of a white power cord with a black device? Not only that, the power cord is too short to reach the outlets in the places I wanted to put it. Really a senseless decision for an otherwise great product.Update: Still love my Echo but would suggest that future generations incorporate ""noise leveling"" so I don't have to adjust the volume for each song. Really dislike having to adjust the volume so frequently. Would be even greater if an update to existing devices could incorporate that technology.

I purchased this to replace my old version that had stopped working. I think it was one of the first editions. We all missed Alexa. I also have a g (not sure if I am suppose to compare here but) Alexa does such a better job of hearing us and following our instructions. She sounds much better when playing music. We don't have a smart house so I have no idea how that works.I do think G answers more of our questions though.Also note: Alexa turned off for some reason - I can't figure out why this happened. It only happened once though. So I am thinking she is fine.

This is the worst purchase I ever made. Was having difficulty with my gen 1 and gen 2 Echo with hub. The gen 1 had no hub but worked the gen 2 had difficulty with recognizing speech and the sound was a bit tinny so I wanted an upgrade and got the gen 4 echo with 2 dot combo. The speech recognition is almost non existent the sound quality is muffled like if you covered it with a towel. We have to scream at the echo to get it to respond and 9 times out of 10 the old gen 2 will respond from 3 rooms away while the new gen 4, 1 foot away does nothing. We set it up between our recliners in the living room on a stand that is clear of obstacles and put the echo at head height when we are seated. I don't know how we could possibly make the conditions any better for the device to hear us. We were also sold a used unit without our knowledge or consent. It was still registered and paired with the previous owner from Rochester NY, and still had a unique name assigned to it from said owner. It's bad enough I'm buying Chinese junk that spies on me but I would never buy USED Chinese junk with the previous owners returned problems still attached to it.

Echo is quite useful doing lots of tasks and there is a good skill set that can be used. The only negative or shortfall is that I cannot Alexa to stream music from Youtube and any music requested has to be routed through Amazon music. I believe it is time to enable Echo's ability to stream music from anywhere on the web. And some of the smart LED bulbs are not recognized by Echo.

It's sound quality is pretty impressive for the price and size. It's not like Bose or Sonos  quality sound but it was also only $60. Alexa is a bit frustrating at times but works pretty good.

We use this speaker in our bathroom and it has no problem playing loud enough over the sound of the bathroom fan and the shower water noise. I believe that placement of the speaker is important, ours is placed about head height on top of a cabinet in the corner and the sound quality if phenomenal. I’m impressed with the rich bass that comes out of such a small speaker. The only thing bad about it in my opinion is that i wish they would have built the power adapter into the speaker rather than being on the end that’s plugged into the wall. Some people have complained about the adapter and cord being either white or black our is white. I think it’s all about how visible the outlet is that it’s plugged into, our is visible so I’d rather have a white adapter rather than a black one sticking out like a sore thumb. Overall I’m extremely pleased with it.

The sound quality doesn't seem to be any better or worse than the older models.  I will say, I like the look of the new Echo, some people don't...  I have six in my little two bedroom apartment (only one of the 4th gen - won't be upgrading the rest unless they fix her ability to hear).  I'm so frustrated, I didn't like repeating myself to my children when they were kids, why would I want to with my Alexa?  You can't blame my voice, I'm a loud stage actress who knows how to annunciate my words!  I really wish an update could be done to make her able to hear better, I do not wish to shout any louder, my neighbors might get a bit upset!  The older models do not seem to have any issues hearing and understanding me, even if I am speaking quietly.  I'm seriously considering returning her and buying a used older model off Facebook Marketplace, it's THAT frustrating.

This product has a great ability of recognizing my voice even when I have a peanut butter sandwich in my mouth.  The sound quality is okay but its probably better to go with the lesser priced one and hook up to a wi-fi speaker.  In other words the sound just ain't all that.  I cant get it to go loud enough. Its just too small to have high quality volume. Working on getting more peripherals hooked up to be able to remotely control more items.  Alexa seems to not hear me sometimes?

My husband loves the Echo products so when this came out he was excited to have a new “toy”. We have several echo devices already in our home so this wasn’t necessary but he wanted it. At the $69 sale price point it’s a good value.If you are limited on space or enjoy the convenience of the smaller dot profile you may want to consider the last version of this dot. I didn’t notice the size specifications for this one so I was shocked when it came and resembles a small bowling ball. My husband normally keeps his dot for the man cave in a drawer and had hoped this one would fit in there as well. Oops!Set up was easy and quick with no issues on the devices end. Sound quality is good and most importantly he is very pleased with it. Given that we have several other echo devices I don’t notice a big change in sound quality. He’s happy so it’s worth the purchase. We will play with the hub experience in the next couple of weeks.

Echo is AWESOME.Something to note: certain apps aren't available for my country (Trinidad & Tobago). No1 spoke about in the reviews I read. Example: I have a lg smart tv (which meets all requirements) I have an apple music subscription and lg thinq app which allows alexa to control my tv and apple music with alexa isnt available in my country nor is amazon music unlimited😒. That really sucks. However, all isnt lost amazon free music is ok & spotify with alexa works so I'd most likely just switch as for my tv issue I'm hoping geeni smart plugs will do the trick until i find an app that does what i need. If you can help solve my tv issue please dont withhold info. I'm still learning, experimenting and loving this lil thing. Voice recognition (caribbean ppl we gotta speak standard english for her to understand our natural dialect might be unrecognizable lol) integration and sound quality is great.

Get extended warranty! Product works, when it works, but unfortunately to me one week before the year warranty expired unit stopped responding to commands. Performed every troubleshooting tips I found online and resorted to apple support. Support did everything I did then said unit was defective and was six days after warranty expired offering 15% discount on a new one. APPLE WATCH HEART RATE ALERT WENT OFF!!! After two hours with support they honored the warranty and sending replacement. Delivery still pending.🙏

Temperature sensor was starting to say that it was below 32°. But if I asked another Alexa device or my phone what the current temperature was in my master bedroom master bedroom it would say 75 and when I checked the Alexa app under this current device everything looks was correct. The only problem was when I asked the actual device the temperature it would say some thing super low like below freezing. On a hunch I googled what my speaker was saying assuming it was given me A measurement in Celsius and converted it to Fahrenheit and I got the correct answer. Even though everything was set correctly in the Alexa app. .so what I did to fix this. Go into Alexa app under the specific device Toggles the measurement units from Fahrenheit to Celsius then asked what the temp was gave me the same reading. Then changed it back to Fahrenheit asked again for the TEMP and that was it she is now saying the temp in Fahrenheit

As a previous Echo dot 3th gen user, The jump in audio quality is insane! The voice recognition is kinda sucks sometimes but overall it gets the job done. The built-in zigbee hub is nice to have for simple device controlling, like Philips Hue bulbs. Giving it 4 stars only because the mic is not very responsive, The big Echo is designed to be in large rooms like living rooms etc. i use it in a small bedroom and it still dosent pickup my voice. so if its struggling to hear me in a small room, i dont know how it will hear the command in a big room.

I really am confused by the performance of my Echo 4th gen.My dot is working fine. I had high hopes and was excited for this one with the hub in it. I read all the reviews online and even watched people play it and compare speakers.I don't know if i got a ""lemon"" in the batches but mine has been malfunctioning repeatedly and sadly I think I have to return it :-( I'm really disappointed b/c I want an alexa device with an integrated hub and I got it at good value on a promotion.  I don't want to return it but I need it to work and now she is not responding, and when she does respond there is terrible feedback noise.Pluses:+ acts as hub+ color good+ design goodCons:- it often doesn't understand my voice from nearby and I have to ""shout"" or ""sternly"" give commands- the volume up or down doesn't always take affect and you have to repeat the command- the sound now started to get crackly and play static feedback with it - has started to ""ignore me"" and it will ligt up blue, i will say ""play jazz music"" and it doesn't do anything- i have a dot in a room nearby (but not close), and the dot will often pick up my voice in the enxt room, even though i am on the sofa sitting directly next to the hub one and the hub will not respond----update on review:amazon customer service did try to help. they are sending me a replacement one to see if it is a hardware issue on this specific device that i got. crossing fingers the new one is better.i did speak with the rep about the difference in amazon plus. vs. studio vs. 4th geninteresting to me that the echo plus 2 are still more expensive than the new 4th gen even though they are ""older"" technology.i suspect the plus 2 have the kinks worked out, wish the price would drop.and maybe some of these issues with my new 4th gen device are teething issues with it being a ""new and improved"" design and inner-parts.also an odd note on the customer service - the team that followe dup on a 2star review, they rang me and i asked to call back later. he mentioned he would email me - got the email, the instructinos said ""you can reply directly to this email"" so I took the time to reply to the email but then got the automatic response that said ""you are writing to an email that no longer accepts incoming messages"" s - so he won't see my response and the alternate contact path is to log a new ticket, which i've already done so i wont resend.

It sounds almost as good as my 3 way 6.5"" ceiling speakers driven my my 400W receiver/amp, at any volume.  Good base for it's size, and very clear mid range.  I upgraded from the first edition Echo to connect it to my new Fire TV.  It was easy to connect and pair through the Alexa app, and the sound is significantly better.  I did not listen to both side by side, but believe the sound is improved in mid range.  And for my needs, I prefer the directional vs. 360 degree sound.  I did like the smaller footprint of the older models, but this looks nicer mounted to the wall next to my TV or in a living room.  It  is also perfect to bring outside.  The voice recognition is excellent, except at very high volumes, you have to get close and scream.  I read the noise filtering is better on the Echo Studio, which is a much better for blasting music.

Following the instructions to connect the Echo and Ring spotlight and pathlight, we could not get the Echo to recognize either of the 2 devices. We called Ring, and after several attempts, we were told the problem was with the Echo, and that we needed to contact Amazon. We called Amazon, and after several attempts, we were told the problem was with Ring to contact them. At this point we are sitting here with equipment that will not pair. We're ready to return it and give up.

Purchased to replace the gen 1 white Echo cylinder that had its WiFi circuit fail after 4 years of daily use.Arrived and setup was easy and it did all the cylinder did , slightly  better sound as well (though fabric cover is not suited for kitchens - so amazon being back a cylinder variant as well , Of hard plastic so it can be cleaned on the outsides with a glass cleaner ).But today - day 5 of use out of the blue the music playing suddenly emitter a loud crackle sound of 1-2 seconds length. Went to investigate the noise. Again the loud crackle and then the music returned. Waited a bit and again. It was happening regularly , about 3 to 4 times a minute.  Unplugged and replugged to see if a reboot would help.  Sitting idle nothing. Asked Alexa to play music and it began playing - and again every 15-20 seconds the loud crackle if 1-2 second length.  Definite hardware failure.By the nature of it I suspect the circuits that feed the digital audio from that source in the cpu over to the digital to analog converter before it goes to the amp , is getting  the data corrupted and so what gets decode isn’t the music signal not now a random jumble of loud digital noise. Packet corruption if you will.So fails on less than a week - a computer or build flaw. Back it goes. Given others habe reported this of may be a bigger batch or systemic failure of some bad components or issue with the board design that fails after some days of use.So if you are buying one in 2022 be sure to plug it in and make use of it playing music daily for at least a few weeks so you can get a refund / exchange more easily.  Don’t leave it in the box for weeks or give it as a gift some days / weeks down the road.

I held off buying the echo because of some reviews that said the voice recognition and sound quality was not very good. When they went on sale I decided to buy it. I can tell you that going from a dot to this is a big upgrade in sound. I have mine located in a small bedroom and use it daily to listen to music. I rarely did that with the dot because the sound quality was so poor. I am not an audiophile but my roommate commented on how good it sounded too.I’ve had no difference in the voice command /recognition that is any different from the dot. It picks up my commands 90% of the time from same distance.

I lost my 1st gen. Echo during the move this summer. So bought this one. It functions well. The sound quality is fine, although I thought the heavy bass is a little muddy. I prefer cleaner definition of sound than the pounding bass. But that’s Ok. Still wish Amazon kept the slender cylinder form from the 1st gen design and metal mesh cover of the speaker. Not a big fan of the globe shape and fabric cover.

When I saw this design I knew immediately I had to have it. It's spherical look matched the look of the spherical lamps in my living room (Ikea Fodo lamps), purchasing with the intent of moving my Echo Plus to a different room in exchange for this new model being the living room's device.Right away I noticed the sound pickup is weaker than my Echo Plus. Having used the Plus for nearly three years in the same location, I was accustomed to a specific level of voice pickup, especially when first entering my home and prompting Alexa to turn on the lights. This new model needs me to speak much louder to throw my voice enough in order for it to pickup and respond accordingly. That's strike one.Next, while I love the design and the light ring makes sense at the base for this design, I decided very early on that the placement of the light ring at the base is counterintuitive as it's difficult to impossible to see if your prompt was recognized if your vantage point is obstructed; this was not the case with the Echo Plus with it's tall cylindrical design. That's strike two.Finally, the sound quality. Thinking it would sound better than the Echo Plus was logical given the Plus model is several years old and this new model boasts more size to house a decent speaker system. Modern audio devices have really stepped up their game with rich sound and deep bass, so I assumed this would perform exceptionally. Unfortunately, I found the audio quality to fall below that of the Echo Plus. I linked all my echo devices so that music will play across all the devices to fill my home. Walking from my living room (where this new Echo lives) into my art studio (where the Echo Plus was moved to) there is an undeniable difference in sound quality, with the Echo Plus clearly being the superior in sound. This new model suffers by not adopting the 360 sound of the Plus and also sounds to have weaker bass in comparison, even after matching the audio settings to the Plus. That's strike three, which is three strikes too many.My final analysis is that this new Echo isn't much more than a larger Echo Dot with the added benefit of the hub that allows integration with Hue bulbs.I will be placing my Echo Plus back into the living room and redesignating this new model as an Auxiliary device in another part of my home. I may purchase a better quality external sound system for it, but in any case, Amazon needs to revisit the Echo with more focus on sound than the physical design because I feel some sacrifices were made to make a product look pretty.

Bought 3 of them and created routine for motion detection and realized that it does not work as intended.

I replaced my ECHO Plus with built-in Hub Ver1 (Generation 1) with this new 4th Gen ECHO and all my 2.4 WIFI device failures went away.  Once or twice a week I had to REBOOT my ROUTER to get my Alexa compatible 2.4 devices back online.  I'm also on my 3rd, expensive, top of the line ROUTER, ASUS-GT AC5300 thinking it was the problem, NOT!  Two weeks now and not a single dropout.  The ASUS router has a very useful network map showing all connected devices.  It used to show DIFFERENT UP Times for different 2.4 devices and some offline.  NOW, all the wireless devices show the same UP time, online on the 2.4 & 5 Gig networks.  I bought the Gen 1 in 2017 and been pulling my hair out trying to troubleshoot the problem for years.  Never once did I see an article blaming the Gen1 Hub being the problem.  Sure hope this helps at least one person.  Vegas OBie

The Pros: It's more compact, and has a nice aesthetic look.  The sound seems a bit better than the 1st Gen, although I don't use it often for music.  It integrates flawlessly into the Alexa environment.The Cons: This is a biggie: after giving it a command, it will NOT respond to a second command right away.  It appears to need a few seconds to ""recycle."" I don't know if this is endemic to ALL Gen 4 Echos, or if it is just an issue w/ mine.  This is NOT the case with the 1st Gen Echo I had, or even the 4th Gen Dots, I have.  Had I known this beforehand, it would have been a deal killer, and I'd have simply ordered another Dot, instead.

I've had Echo devices from the beginning and with each new one, more get spread around the house so Alexa is always nearby to give me the weather forecast, solve a math problem, or answer questions that arise.But, it was hard to find Echo devices that allowed for stereo headphones to be plugged in (and I may be wrong, but I don't think any of them allow for Bluetooth headphones). Living in a neighborhood where the houses are in close proximity, being able to use headphones to listen to music is the only civil thing to do (sadly, my neighbors do have to hear me singing to the music without the benefit of the full music background).  This was one of the few Echos that have both a 'line in AND a line out' capability and with the headphones, the sound is every bit as good as listening to the original CD.  Love this Echo!

I’m late to the party a bit. Just recently I finally warmed up to the idea of having a voice recognition device/assistant in my house. Alexa and I are becoming great fast friends. The sound quality to this Gen 4 is awesome! Oh course my take He’s going to be a bit different from the others who have a lot of experience with the different generations. Having nothing to compare my current Gen 4 Alexa to, I am delighted with the sound quality. Each morning after she and I great each other, she plays some awesome music for me to get my day off to a good start. Connecting the Bluetooth feature so I could play my Apple Music was pretty easy and seamless also. This device sounds awesome for this price point. Much better than my LG Soundbar that was almost impossible to get the Bluetooth to connect.... I got the glacier blue and it blends quite nicely in my home! Great buy, I’d highly recommend 👍🏽

A dud all around:1.  The globe shape takes up more space in every instance where it's put than its cylindrical predecessors2.  The internal temperature sensor is often inaccurate.  Apparently it updates no more often than every 30 minutes.3.  The buggy alexa app occasionally shows the echo 4 temperature on its status screen, but most of the time it doesn't display -- the temperature line is missing. Previous versions prominently displayed the temperature.4.  The temperature measures in C despite setting it to F in the alexa app.  The only way to change it is through a voice command to the echo.5.  Sound quality is markedly worse -- and is especially directional. Vocals are muffled and no amount of adjustment makes much difference.6.  The ""equalizer"" is still profoundly primitive with only three adjustment -- bass (which is already too heavy even at the lowest setting); midrange; and treble.7.  No digital signal processing?  This is 2021, not 2001.8.  The on-board processor(s) are very slow to react to commands -- and it's not related to the internet or WiFi.9.  Room speaker groups don't work -- one of the three speakers in the group will work fine and any of the three will work fine, but when asked to play in a group, two of the three speakers behave as if they have poor connections with glitchy sound that then drops in and out.  All are on the same WiFi dedicated network, and I've reset them multiple times.10.  The action light ring on the bottom is hard to see and is largely hidden by the globular shape.  The action ring is on in my image with a waiting notification -- can you see it?  Me neither.11.  There is some sort of sound-based occupancy sensor in this version of the echo -- again, doesn't work reliably, poorly documented; and poorly implemented and integrated with the buggy alexa app.12.  Still no way to interact with the echo devices using a web browser -- forced to use the buggy app.13.  Volume normalization across feeds is abominable.  Some sources, BBC World Service, for example are quiet -- others, such as the NPR feed are loud.  This should be tested before feeds are allowed to go live.  Even better, sound normalization should be automated in the cloud if not on the device.  It's maddening to be required to manually adjust the volume on EVERY SINGLE source!To say I am disappointed in these $100 duds is an understatement.I will be returning these ASAP.

If you like echo's this is nice EXCEPT the CHARCOAL model comes with an ULTRA WHITE power supply and cable.  The cable sticks out like a sore thumb, I just cannot walk by this with out seeing that ULTRA WHITE cable and being annoyed.  I might as well just tossed white extrension cables all over the house.It is so annoying that this will probably end up in the basement or the garage where I won't be judged when guests to my home see it.

Good addition to our home for playing music. Much better sound quality than standard echo models...but not equal to other equally priced speakers. We bought at 1/2 off and at that price is a very good quality speaker. At this price, however,  should include integrated battery rather than add-on at additional cost.

So easy to learn how to get Alexa to entertain me with music, Audible books.  I'm in my 70's and a bit hesitant when it comes to learning new technology.

She's my buddy now and I'm looking forward to creating with her.

The device voice recognition is very good and it helps with automations around the house.As an external speaker, the story is different.Connecting via Bluetooth: Sound quality is OK for a device this size; this was expected. The annoying ""feature"" is that it screams announcing ""PLAYING FROM JOHN's DESKTOP"", and this happens in the middle of meetings. So I decided to use it with a 3.5mm audio cable.3.5mm audio cable: The Echo has a terrible hissing noise. It is not a ground loop, it is not the cable, it is not the audio source. I just took another speaker that I have and there is zero hissing connecting it to the same power outlet, same audio source, and same 3.5 audio cable.So if you want to use the Echo as an external speaker for your laptop or cellphone, look for another device; this is not the one.

Ok, was a skeptic, total conspiracy theorist and didn't want Mr. Bezos listening in on private, household conversations; however, after the wife purchased an Echo and a pair of Echo Dots, I wish we made the leap earlier. We have a 2 story home and a 2 story, detached workshop, studio, office and the Echo's make it easy and convenient to instantly communicate when apart. I've been able to expedite my evening client calls using the Echo as well as organize grocery or hardware store shopping lists, playlists...whatever...still learning how to take advantage of Alexa via the Echo and Echo Dot. Game changers for our household! (Whoever's listening in...hope you enjoy our evenings!)

We like to listen to the local radio stations but Alexa is unable locate or tell me how to get them on Alexa.  Tried to use the aps she suggested but don't work.

I'm psyched to have finally pulled the trigger on this purchase.  I have a 2nd gen Echo elsewhere in the house and enjoyed it.  Now I just added two Echo 4th gens in my home office.  I have them at opposite sides of my desk and successfully grouped them, and added a Home Theater setup to connect with my FireTV over my desk.  The sound quality is amazing - deep base - and some added unexpected perks with lyrics showing up on the FireTV when I stream music.  I also love using the Theater sound instead of my crappy TV speakers (old 42"" flat panel with nice picture, but poor sound).  Now my movies sound so much better!  The FireTV remote even picks up volume control now on the Echo's too.  Of course - I can also tell Alexa to change the volume as well.The only quirky thing that others have pointed out (small nit for me) - is the white power cord with the Black Echo.  Strange choice.

Don't like the light ring on the bottom - harder to see from across a room. The round shape is interesting, but not particularly practical on a desk/table. The mics don't seam to pick up as well as my old gen 2 echo plus. And for some odd reason the alexa voice itself is much quieter than music on the newer echo plus, which does not appear to be adjustable. Mapping my zigbee lights (hue) to the new plus has been a nightmare, though I've got it mostly working now - not sure why the configuraiton for those lights couldn't be stored and shared with the new plus. Also, don't have to echo plus devices going at the same time - will result in duplicate devices - still trying to clean that up and may ultimately have to reset the whole works. Otherwise performs as all other Alexa devices - remarkably well and does what I want with music, weather, controlling smart devices, etc.

Update November 2021: I have taken this echo out of service. Last night I ask her to play Klove radio station for me. She said I needed to get Amazons music service.  Told her to stop and tried again. She wanted to play Christmas music.  Told her to stop. Ask her what the temperature would be and she started to play Christmas music. Took her out of service. Ask my echo show to play klove for 30 minutes. Her answer was ""playing klove fromm H..... I heart radio for 30 minutes.""I think Amazon had different clouds for different echos. I have my dots be down but my show5 works fine. My dots don't argue we me like this echo does and this on is always trying to get me to buy things, a lot more than dots and shows does.Original post: I have echos from the very first one to now including echo show 5.  The sound quality is the best of all.  This new one (4th generation) has problem of hearing you and understanding you. I almost have to yell to get her to hear me and then she doesn't understand. Example. I have lights with wifi bulbs (2 different brands)  I almost always have to tell her twice to turn on or off. I have a Amazon smart plug and the same.  easy to set up and easy to get other products to work with her.Update:  I’ve changed my post from 3 Stars to 1. She’s getting more hard of hearing. She went bonkers the other night and could only do a few commands. She kept telling me that she could not connect to the internet. All others were okay. I finally unplugged her then restarted. She then told me she needed to recalibrate. That’s a new one.Update: less than a hour after posting the update Amazon customer services called and worked through the problem. The wakeup name Alexa is a corrupted file. Changing to echo made it better.  We will see if that holds. Change from 3 stars to one. Will move It to 2 stars. If it holds i will change ratings to 3 or higher.UPDATE September 30 2021:I’m going to go back to one star. Her hearing problem is getting worse. She now argues with me. I tell her to turn on plug for porch and she gives ne the definition of a porch. I must tell her two times to turn on porch. She then tells me the porch is not a command. Go to another echo same command and porch comes on.I’ve decided to remove her and put in my old first generation puck in her place. It’s does not miss a command.After reading all the reviews about her hard of hearing I ordered anyway. My advice is don’t buy this one.For information the command to turn on porch was at 4:00 am nothing was on in room to distract her. And had to give command twice and hear what a porch was.

Wow! We moved from an Echo 2nd generation to this new Echo 4th generation and I am amazed at the huge difference in the sound quality. The new Echo 4th generation really rocks. It even has excellent bass without having a separate bass speaker. I'm listening to the Scorpions right now and it sounds fantastic. It also sounds great with classical and folk music. We have it mounted under a kitchen cabinet using the Amazon Echo mount and wow, it sounds fantastic. It isn't as good as our Echo Studio and Echo Bass combined unit but it's a darn close second. I'm sure enough of the sound quality that I put the new Echo into my downstairs sound group along with the Studio. Voice control is good as always and she runs our many smart lights and switches with ease. She also plays nice with our nest home thermostat and other smart devices. All in all this was an amazing upgrade. Plus installation is so easy with the Alexa App and Amazon sidewalk looks promising too

Definitely a step up from the echo Dot. However, I was a little disappointed in the overall sound quality. Also, Alexa still needs some work on voice recognition, and her search capabilities. Very good job of making lists, finding music, and doing some of the other skills. Searchs regarding general knowledge often return information unrelated to the request.

Just disconnected both Amazon Echo devices, The other two I’d already send in as they were end of life.Amazon does not understand ethical boundaries any longer.

Forget and delete should mean just that.Never will I purchase another Amazon branded product.

Alexa has been a real pain in the butt. I primarily use it for playing music, and many times it won't recognize what I request even when I say it over and over again. It always defaults to Amazon music or a radio station I never heard of.  Yesterday I asked it to play music from Bridgerton and it couldn't find it. ?????? I had to direct it to Spotify and that took 5 different tries.  When it finally did, I couldn't get it to change to another music type.  I told it to play classical music and it started the Bridgerton series. I find this device highly annoying and not that good.

The device arrived only three days ago, so I don’t have much experience or basis on which to evaluate it. It sounds good. Alexa plays stuff via other apps, so that part seems good. I’m still playing with it. (And I dislike how Amazon wants a review as soon as it’s just out of the box.)

I got this hub and a 4th gen dot as well, and they're both incredible. Others are saying she can't hear well, but I can speak in a soft voice across a room and she'll hear me! It's amazing how many questions she can answer, and the easter eggs questions are so fun. A lot of the time when she doesn't understand you, it comes down to phrasing. Amazon music isn't great, but if you have Spotify it doesn't matter. Both this and the dot are pretty easy to set up, especially if you have your account synced before it even arrives. I recommend even more on sale, which apparently is rather often.

My Alexa could not do the things it was supposed to do.

Surprisingly good sound from such a small unit. I bought this for my son for Christmas two Christmas’ ago.

The speaker works well in a large room and we like the looks and color (blue), even though the cord is white. However, the Alexa apt is frustrating and has been since my first Echo Dot (original generation). Then, there's the Amazon Music Unlimited, which you would think would work great with the Amazon Alexa AND the Amazon Echo speakers. Well, I don't know which to blame, but here is an example: I paired my new 4th Generation Echo with my existing 1st gen. Echo Dot (in another room via the Alexa apt), then requested  an artist playlist (i.e. ""play music by Neil Diamond"") and they both worked - for a while. Then, after about six hours (which included Christmas music in March) the gen 4 Echo (mid-song) shut off while the old Echo Dot kept playing. Trying to correct the situation means: Stop Alexa, wait a while, then start over, if you're still inclined. This happens All the time when leaving on long enough. The sound volume also varies song-to-song so that I frequently manually turn the sound up or down. The sound quality is surprisingly good, otherwise. Alexa voice recognition, even after a substantial break-in period is ify: sometimes when requesting a playlist or song Alexa will want to sell me a book.Some artists play for hours and some for an hour, even though they have many more songs to their credit (i.e. Bill Medley played for one hour with three repeats of ""The Time of Our Lives""). If you have a lot of patience, have fun, but, sooner-or-later things get frustrating.Update: After contacting Amazon, a very helpful customer rep. guided me through a Factory Reset. Afterwards she promised the device would work 'perfectly'. It works worse. Now about tree hours both 4th Gen. Echo's hiss during playback then shut down with my original 1st Gen. Echo Dot still playing (on my 'everywhere' group inside our house). Then it took 6-7 attempts to get my old Echo Dot to stop. Before I purchased the two 4th Gen. Echo's, everything worked fine .. not 'perfectly', but fine. Good Luck! IF you buy these .. Still not sure if the problem is the new Echo's or Amazon Music Unlimited. Another update (4-20-21): While we do enjoy Amazon Music (when it works) and the sound is good .. the Echo is in a large room so I decided to add another for stereo and coverage .. call me stupid for still hoping for a good experience .. what convinced me to buy another (?) .. Amazon put it on sale and promised to include a free smart plug .. well, Amazon came through again and didn't include the smart plug and their customer service can't remedy. At least I got the sale price, but, I am increasingly NOT becoming a loyal Amazon customer. 6/10/21 Update: Alexa Sucks!: Frequently doesn't play what you ask for, or, when it does, stops playing, mid-song, when it wants, then freezes so you can't play any music until ""SHE"" feels like it (even doing a 'unplug' restart doesn't help). These speakers are marketed for Alexa and Amazon Music users and the experience (six months worth) is frustrating, maddening, and just plain bad.

Overall I like the 4th gen Echo a lot as compared to my original 1st gen Echo.  With the Prime day sale, I purchased two of them and set them up as a stereo pair. It works well with Amazon music, but has limitations when trying to stream music to the Echo pair over Bluetooth or using the AUX in connector.  Either of those methods only steam the music to whichever echo is connected by Bluetooth or AUX, not to the second paired Echo.  I suppose this doesn't matter that much if you use Amazon Music Unlimited, but if you have an extensive music collection with playlists, or other good reason to want to use Bluetooth or AUX IN to play media, then you are only able to do it with one of your Echos.

Love the sound this unit puts out specially compared to our 2nd Generation it replaced. Was able to connect it via Bluetooth to our Main Denon stereo setup in another room so we can have music not only in the kitchen where the Dot 4 PS is, but throughout the downstairs of our house. You can do this via the Alexis phone app.Slight downside is the voice recognition on this unit works great for my voice, but it's not cooperating with my wife's voice so much (e.g., frustration). Our old unit never had that issue.

So I love Alexa and most of the Alexa products.  I have the new-gen 4 to replace Gen 3 so it would have the hub.  The hub part works great.  However, when I am in the kitchen and the device is so close to me (same position as older model)  I have to yell at Alexa and wait (note; no music or anything playing) then speak the command.  In previous-gen versions, I have been able to talk at a normal volume and pace and Alexa picks up what I am saying right away.Now 1 of 2 things happen 1. I have to pause for 3 -4 seconds after saying Alex or it simply does not respond OR 2. the echo dot device in another room picks up the request and plays the response in that room.Also while it looks super nice compared to other models, the light indicator being at the bottom is almost useless.  If I have a notification I can't see the light , where when the light was at the top of the device you could see the light from a distance.  Now it's just hidden and pretty useless if you are not right on top of the unit.Also playing music on this is not nearly as loud or pronounced as previous gen models.  This sounds muted (so does the dot 4th gen) , sadly I feel like this 4th gen went down hill and not much able to be done about it if you're a alexa ecosystem. household

As an anti social sort of person, I've been a bit more vocal and okay with it asking it to switch lights status mostly,  mom mostly uses for reminders,  and other small random things but not much else, i know others use it for a bunch more but maybe with time I'll open up to more stuff.  Works long distance between multiple rooms too.

I was surprised by how little this thing can actually do and by how un-seamless the user experience is. The biggest smart-home items I have that I wanted to connect are my robot vacuum and robot mopper, from Neato and iRobot respectively.The Alexa app has robot vacuums as a main device category, but connecting them is really difficult. For the Neato vacuum, you have to connect your Neato account to Amazon. Fair enough, except that it only works if you used the same email address for both accounts! You will have to change your Neato email address to whatever you use with Amazon. Sorry if you wanted privacy.Connecting the iRobot mopper just didn't work. You have to install the iRobot skill, then add the bot as a device, but it won't connect to my Braava Jet robot at all. There is really no way to get help with it either. Amazon can't offer support for the dozens of 3rd party devices they claim to support, and iRobot doesn't know how to get it to work either. That is a hint of a failing ecosystem.I don't have any smart lights or anything like that yet, so what's left in terms of functionality is low-level features like the flash briefing. But even this seems like it's been neglected by Amazon. Many of the news sources on offer have stopped updating, so you can add them but Alexa just says they are unavailable every time. It's really difficult to customize also. I noticed if you ask Alexa how to edit your flash briefing she gives you inaccurate directions that don't reflect the current version of the Alexa app. If you manage to figure it out, you realize you can't really add useful things to your flash briefing like air quality for your city. It seems the boundaries of the experience are quite narrow, and they are becoming more narrow as the ecosystem shrinks. This is supposed to be a flagship device for Amazon and a key part of their strategy, but the experience has atrophied badly.

Bought this for my Mother so she can be connected with us. She lives alone and doesn't want to admit that she could probably use a ""life alert"". I bought her the echo on my account so that it can be an extension of our house. We live about 20 miles apart so it bridges that gap. Theres a bit of a learning curve but she is getting the idea. She feels a little safer. She doesn't want to have to call 911 and has been known to have dizzy spells. Thankfully, the one time she fell I was in town and she had her phone on her to call me. But now, with the echo in a central location in her small house, she just has to speak from where she is and she can get ahold of me if she needs to. It has brought peace of mind to us both.

Buttons are kinda pointless. No need for one to mute and one to unmute. Also alexa can control volume through voice control… a button to stop the music instantly may have been helpful. I love the communication feature I can send messages to home to verbally announce or display on my firetv.

Nice device with pretty light band at base. Fits easily everywhere. Purchased this in order to hear music when I’m home doing things around the house, like cooking. I asked Alexa which device had the best sound quality for music and she said this one! However, a friend gave a different device to my aunt that sounds much better and I will probably buy that next. Don’t know what it is. It’s round and cylindrical, and tall. Great, balanced sound with every song I’ve ever requested from Alexa. Going to pick it out now!! It’s sounds great in the open area of our cottage in VT. Love that one! This one is good, step above the Echo Show I have for music sound. But it’s still not nearly as clear or balanced as the one I can’t name!! Sorry!

This is my first Alexa device, so I wasn't quite sure how much I would enjoy having it before I got it, Now that I have one, I'm pretty enamored with it. It's pretty cool seeing what all it can do. I've never been that interested in smart home stuff, but now that I'm experiencing it I'm intrigued by the possibilities and will likely add additional devices around the house in the future. The sound quality of this little speaker is pretty impressive with a good amount of bass and the ability to adjust the sound through the Alexa app also. I'm loving it!

I was very pleasantly surprised at the depths of the sound that these echoes put out. I have a 1300 square-foot condo and I have three echoes and two echo dots… The reason I have them is a no longer need speakers of any kind for excellent sound throughout my house. No matter what room I go into including my bathrooms, I have consistent sound and it is good sound. The Echo dots alone sound tinny so they really fill in the blanks…

20220508. This is an Alexa device, but it seems to have trouble recognizing when you are talking to it. I've found I have to pause after saying Alexa before I add the instruction. Even then, it often takes 4 or 5 tries to get the blue ring to light up. This behavior is consistent with both of these Echos, and with the larger version (I bought the three pack).I don't know what Amazon is doing under the covers, but I will say I've noticed a general degrading in voice recognition on other Echos, especially on the Echo Show. My guess is they have been dorking with the OS and have added too many ""features"" so that the CPU is overwhelmed and not as responsive as it once was.For example, I am now queried on a regular basis to give a rating to products I bought, and reminded that consumables I've purchased in the past might be running out. I don't need that stuff, and I would far prefer to have an Echo that is responsive and less of an ad machine for Amazon.20220511. UPDATE. Amazon called me with some suggestions for improving the response. I've made the adjustments. I will update when I've had time to see if it makes a difference. I am adding one star for Amazon following up.
","Negative"

Update: Rating changed from 4 to 3 stars. The new devices (have 2 now and am kind of regretting it) are a step up with sound quality for sure. But the microphones and voice recognition are really poor. Have to repeat commands (even simple ones like ""end timer"") many times.  Heck, the devices have a hard time picking up ""Alexa"" wake word most of the time. Haven't looked at the internals, but guessing that the physical positioning of microphones in the new ball shaped package was ""good in theory"" but just poor design. Either that or the software upgrades are anything but.And Amazon is not doing anything about the ugly white cords and adapters. Shame. The round package could be cool - if it wasn't for the ugly white only cords and adapters (and performance issues of course). It is fine with the white one we have. It might even work for the blue. But it is gosh-awful with the charcoal unit. If a person wants a dark colored smart device, it is probably in part because the location needs a dark color. Tell me again how white cords/adapters make sense?-------------------------------------------------------------------Overall the device is a step up from 2nd gen device. Sound quality much improved and reasonable for price. Voice recognition not as consistent as with 3rd gen Dots for some reason.Huge esthetics issue: only have white cords and power adapters. REALLY UGLY with dark gray/black unit. Especially bad if putting somewhere that needs dark color.Money saving deal but come on Amazon. Y’all are better than this!

I'm finding that an Echo Dot a long hallway away wills sometimes recognize the wake word faster and more reliably than this Echo does. Surprising and disappointing. However, it was a reasonable upgrade from my old first-generation Alexa, especially on sale and with a trade-in allowance for the old unit. Not delighted but it does the job, and sound quality is better than a Dot (not sure about the tower models yet).

I had a 2nd gen Echo and love it. I traded it in for this one. I'm so surprised by how rich the sound is. Being a musician I'm sensitive to poor audio quality. It's not as good as a great set of speakers, but for its size it is really nice.My one big complaint, and why I won't give it two stars, is that it shuts down ALL THE TIME. I don't know if it is heat related or what but it will play for maybe 30-45 minutes and then it just stops. My old V2 did not do that. I could leave it playing all day. Not sure if this is something others have seen, but it happens every day.I also wish you could more easily turn the voice recognition on and off without lights showing you it is off. Ugh. So awful usability wise.

When my Alexa v.1 finally died I was afraid of the same struggles I had getting it working.Things have changed!I just needed the app and the WiFi password.  Opened the app and searched for the new Echo that then prompted for the password.  I had to step away ... and didn't really hurry back because I thought this was going to be the hard part.  Then I heard a tone from the Echo.  I asked Alexa the time, she answered (too loudly) by naming me personally as my last Echo did ... I asked her to turn down the volume and that was the end of the new configuration.  Things have definitely changed for the better!

Echo (4th Gen) definitely sounds better than its predecessor, but Alexa voice recognition is not as good as the previous gen. In addition, Alexa misses my voice when the volume is set to 5. So I need to be closer and repeat the command again. It will be 5 stars if the voice recognition works as previous gen.

I finally made the plunge and purchased the Echo when I broke my ankle. Alexa has been very helpful with my limited mobility. I purchased this Echo, an Echo dot and Echo flex for 1800 foot 2 story townhouse. I like that I can also access Alexa from my iPhone when needed. Being able to “announce” when I need help has been a lifesaver. Now it doesn’t matter if my family members phones are off or in another room. My only complaint is that there was not an easy way to figure out what Echo items I needed to cover my house. I ended up purchasing more than I needed and returned one of the Echo dots. Overall Echo has been a great addition to my home.

This ECHO keeps a low profile on the counter but puts out room filling music that is surprisingly rich.  I'm seriously considering removing the larger wired speakers in that space.

While not pleased I had to upgrade from earlier generation Echo, after purchase of Firestick 4K max, I'm glad I did,  The pain was eased by the $30 trade-in and credit towards this new Echo.I purchased two and, paired with my Subwoofer, has provided an excellent Home Theater for our TV viewing experience.I beleive you cannot buy a better set of speakers for home listening unless you spend a lot more cash.

I've had many Echo devices starting with my first when I was invited to buy a 1st gen before they went to market. I currently have 2 Echo Shows, 2 4th gen Echos, 2 Echo Dots and an Echo Auto. We've always like the Echo products...until recently. About a month ago, we went to bed and as usual  told Alexa to play our SleepyTime playlist. Sometime in the night, she stopped playing and when we tried to get the playlist going again she said she couldn't reach the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I found our internet was fine so I tried reconnecting the Echo. No matter what I tried, she would not connect. If I asked her a question, she would just reply with ""I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. The internet is not reachable. ""I even did a factory reset - still no good. Thinking it was bad, I went to Best Buy and bought another 4th gen Echo. It too too would not connect. I tried over and over - no good.  So, for kicks, I decided to use my wife's phone and her Amazon account and in the first attempt the device connected. To eliminate my phone as a problem. I opened a brand new Fire Tablet registered to me. I first updated the Alexa app and attempted to connect the 4th gen Echo to my account - no good. We've done coutless resets, but nothing works with my account. Her account, no problem. I have taken the Echo to my work and it does the same thing there as well. The problem with using my wife's account is that all of the other devices, Kasa plugs, Hue lights etc., are attached to my account. I had bought a pack of 4 Kasa plugs and they cannot attach to my account either. I can use them within the Kasa app, but cannot attach them to my Alexa account. Basically, my account is somehow damaged. I called tech support after about 10 days of trying to fix this myself. I was hung-up on twice, but eventually got someone in Echo tech support. After trying many things, even screen sharing from the new Fire tablet, the technician said that this was very unusual and should not be behaving like this. The devices register on my account, but they just won't work. She told me she and her team would need time to  investigate this issue and asked me for a good callback time for the next day. I said 5:30pm would be good. I never got the call and my devices still are not working. Through my efforts, I have eliminated my network, my phone, my tablet, the Alexa app, the Echo devices- everything but my Alexa account. I have no choice at this point but to give them a one star review until this is fixed.

I’m really enjoying the help from Alexa on so many things.  I first ordered some smart switches for an area it was hard to get to, with dimmers and a three-way, and knew I needed Alexa.  It works perfectly, plus in addition I have found it useful when asking questions she can answer and playing music, and so much more.  The setup was very easy and I think the sound is incredibly good, has a great solid base.  I put it in the kitchen/dining area.  Because I love it so much, I also ordered an Echo Dot to go along with it, which the sound is still good but not quite as great as this Echo 4th Generation (understandably), and I have it in the bedroom.  I’m so happy with this purchase and being able to have the assistance of smart technology—finally!

I have echo gen 2, 3 now 4. Also several dots, original Show, Show 8. This device is, by far, the best sounding. Not sure where the negative sound reviews come from. Also Mic sensitivity is fine. It goes into power save mode, so you may have to wake it twice first time, but after that its sensitive. I got the blue one.

I just upgraded from the 1st Gen Amazon Echo. My first gen Echo started glitching and becoming unresponsive on me. I figured I upgrade. This ball thing is so ugly.

While the sound is much improved; I'd rather liked the method for which the volume was controlled in the Echo 1st Gen.  With Echo 1st Gen all you had to do was twist the top.  With the Ball 4th Gen, you have to go feeling for the +/-.  One added plus to the Alexa 4th Gen, is the battery attachment.  Today I am to receive the battery.  Let's hope it performs well.  Would I buy another 4th Gen; yeah, the sound is worth the cost.  Sure wish one could twist the upper half of the ball to adjust the volume; that would have been better.We have used the 4th Gen Alexa for 1/2 months; the only problem we have noticed is that, and I should first say; the 4th Gen is geared more toward digital devices, with that said; the problem it has is that it does not voice recognize our request to play music by ""U2.""  Its response is to direct us to enable ""youtube"" by using the Alexa app.  At the Alexa app, there isn't a method to solve this problem.  The only solution we found was to request a specific album or song from U2.  Then Alexa 4th Gen has a better chance at granting your request.

I love my echo 4th gen. My only complaint is that I got a white one instead of the blue one I ordered, but the color has nothing to do with how it functions. I got the set that comes with 2 echo dots.The voice recognition is amazing,  I hardly have to  raise my voice for her to hear me from the kitchen unless there's a lot going on.  I often play music on it and this being my first time owning an echo I find nothing wrong with the sound quality. I read a lot of reviews stating the last Gen was better but I have nothing to compare it to. As a first time user set up was simple and quick. Finding out where to put it was a little tough but only because we're in a tiny apartment at the moment. I can't wait to keep building my smart home.

Much better sound quality that my Echo Plus 2nd gen and older dots.  Better bass, mic is perfect, overall sound quality is clear, crisp, and way more pristine that the Echo Plus 2nd gen.  Set up with the Alexa app takes about 45 seconds.  All you do is go into your app, select devices, Echo, and it sets itself up!  Much less laborious than the older dots and echos, which seem to take forever to set up.  The new Echo also has a threaded hole for standard bolt placement to attach ut.to tables, etc... great way to keep it secure to shelves without fear if knocking it over.

I used to own an older Echo. This generation's round design is really large! It works in a large room like a kitchen, but might be less suited to something like a nightstand, since it kind of sticks out in a room.Sound quality is pretty good, but it comes out of the box with really loud low-range and bass. I use it for podcasts, and peoples' voices just sounded absurdly low and bassy out of the box. I used the Alexa app to bring the bass down to -3, and it sounds much more normal for voice.

I feel like I'm a fanboy of Alexa. I have Echo dot 4th gen, Echo 4th gen and Echo Plus and I love the capabilities of this smart device and the sound quality.Yesterday though, I tried pairing all of the devices so they will play together, and after trying so many different things, I got 2 devices to work, but the Echo dot just can't connect to the other 2. Not as ""Alexa play everywhere"", and not by adding it to the group in the app.Alexa also acts strangely when she doesn't understand something and just bleeps something and shuts off. If I ask a long question, she'll cut me and start operating based on half of my sentence.She never was able to answer something that is relevant to the previous thing we talked about. For example: ""Alexa, what is the tallest building"" and she would tell me ""Burj Khalifa"", I'd ask ""And what is its height"" and she wouldn't know what is ""it"", she doesn't know we just spoke about the Burj Khalifa.The thing is that its been so many years already and it seems like there is no progress in her abilities and sometimes it's seems like she gotten worse through the years.I used to be able to play ""My sleep playlist from spotify"" but now she will always look for playlists made by Spotify instead of playing the playlists I created. Even if I'll name the playlist ""sleep by me"" or some other more specific name of a playlist that isn't public on Spotify, she'll say ""Sorry , I don't know a playlist called ""Sleep by me"" even though that is exactly the name, and she's connected to my Spotify user.

I have two of the new Gen 4 Echo's in Black. They sound very good. I still bump up the Bass(+2) and Treble(+1) and they sound great. The new spherical shape looks great but because they are covered on the top mainly with a fabric they can be dust catchers. The Voice recognition seems faster than the previous units and pretty accurate. I love that they have a temperature sensor built in them. ""Alexa, what is the temperature in here""My biggest gripe, and it's pretty trivial, why oh why do they make the power supply white with white cable? My device is Black and the cable just looks awkward being white hanging out the back.Overall, I recommend this unit to my friends and family.P.S. I also tell friends and family to stay away from the new Echo Dot 4th Gen. It has horrible sound. The 3rd Gen Echo Dot sounded way way better.

The product is great and I intend enjoy more music on it as time goes on. But we found Alexa’s voice had a different tone than on the echo dot 3.

I needed a ""decent"" sounding speaker that had Alexa for my large-ish garage. This easily fills a quiet garage, but will be pushed if there are louder garage sounds. The sound quality isn't really super high quality, it's more room filling for the size. That's all I need in that environment. I do particularly care about good sound quality in general, so I might be more critical than most. Not being a sound snob, just saying most will fine the sound quality perfectly fine, so YMMV. I like that the new design is more directional. The older designs were omni directional which doesn't make much sense unless your speaker is in the middle of a room. Most place them closer to a wall, so this has more precise, less muddy sound. A small little detail on this speaker that scores points with me is the standard speaker mounting hole. This is minor but greatly helps mounting options for me.

Previously we had another Echo we would bring on the deck in the summer, but when I saw this one and that you could use it wirelessly, i jumped on it.

Does justice to the rich sounds of Etta James and Nina Simone.  Yes, it looks a bit odd and not a style i would normally choose, so that's why i took off a star.

I bought this item to upgrade my Echo Plus in July 2021, after two months my Phillips Hue light bulbs stopped working with the unit.  When trying to troubleshoot the issue I lost the ability to restore or add light bulbs back to the Alexa smart home network.  In working with the Amazon team, a replacement device was sent but the same issue re-occurred in December 2021, almost the same time period as the prior unit.  As a hub device that works with Zigbee devices, Phillips Hue Lights should be listed needing a hub for it to work with this unit.I am not sure if other Phillips Hue users are having the same issue, this was my experience.  I would not suggest buying this Echo if you are a Phillips Hue user unless you buy the Phillips Hue Hub.Note: I also have other smart home items and I did not have a bad experience with those items, just the Phillips Hue Lights.

Love the sound. It's not audiophile quality,, but it's pretty darn good for such a small item. I love that I can play the same song throughout the house.If you are already familiar with Echos, you know what Alexa can do. She's useful in a ton of ways. My tall, cylindrical Echo has been with me from before they were generally for sale, I was part of the marketing pool. I loved Alexa immediately. She's been providing information and entertainment for years now without a hitch. The new Echo is just as reliable.Easy connection to my wifi, great sound, what's not to like? Well for me, there is one thing buts it's purely preference. I like the tall cylindrical shape better than the globe shape. It has a narrower footprint and fits into more places better for me. Other than that quibble, not a complaint.

I was not in favor of Alexa in our house.  But we wanted a better sound system.  After looking around we bought this base system with the two small echoes, then after a day ordered a third small echo.  SO the main echo is in one room and three small ones in other rooms.  It was well worth it for sound as well as the other features such as telling us when someone rings the doorbell etc.  I also like that I now have a Bluetooth speaker in each room that doesn't have to be recharged and can be connected by voice to my personal device for stored music in one room while others listen to different music in another room.

Voice recognition works great.Great sound quality, especially the bass, for such a relatively small device.However, Alexa is pretty stupid.  Alexa cannot or will not search through all the music apps I've chosen to find the best choice for what I requested.  Amazon should provide for telling Alexa to make longer, deeper searches if and when desired.  If I want to listen to a music type for more than an hour (or even half an hour) I always choose other internet music alternatives over Alexa including playing the apps I've chosen Alexa to use.

The Echo 4th Gen. is everything that the Echo has to offer and more when it comes to Sound Quality. The fact that the 4th Gen. Echo can be linked to create Stereo Sound with two of these devices is awesome, it really creates fuller movie theater effect, to top it off, you may also add a subwoofer to the set. Amazing sound quality.

I recently decided to go big and get an echo from my echo dot. However, this system packs bass but the sound travels just as far as my dot did (weird). I got this on sale so I guess it was okay for the price.

Voice recognition is solid. It picks up on my wake words better than some of my dots, and definitely better than my flex. Most surprising was the sound quality. I anticipated a better sound than my echo dots, but wow. Major upgrade! Highly recommend. I can't compare it to the studio or subwoofer, but compared to the older echos and echo dots, much better quality.

I have 4 echos. At first they worked beautifully. I liked being able to have the same program playing on all the devices while I worked around the house. However, the last couple of weeks I can barely get one device to play.  I can’t figure out what is wrong.5/3/21 update: When I posted the above paragraph, I received a call from Amazon customer service, and was given some steps to take to correct the problem.  They are all working fine right now.  Fingers crossed.One of my favorite things to do with the Echos is to have them all play the same radio station.  As I walk around the house doing my chores, I can listen to the music wherever I am.There's lots more the echos can do.  I'm sure I have only scratched the surface.Update 5/4/21: Customer service helped me yesterday and the echoes worked fine after that.  Now I am  having intermittent problems again where one or more of my echos stop playing.  I don't know what is going on.  I am not very tech savvy and it is irksome that this keeps happening.  My echos (I have 4) worked beautifully together for the first couple of weeks and now I keep having these issues. So I am dropping my rating back to 3 stars for now until I can get this problem resolved.

I saw many people were complaining about audio quality and while the Alexa voice assistant doesn't sound the best, when I turn music on, this unit really shines compared to the old dots and I'm thrilled about that because that's one of the main reasons I purchased this over another model. The setup process was simple, plug in the unit, go into the Alexa app, and you'll see it listed in your new device list. Click on the name and choose your wireless network and you are done. Can't really ask for a better setup and user experience when you have a device that is mostly only usable through voice commands. I'm thrilled I got this and would recommend it if you want to use Alexa to play music but don't want a speaker system taking up extra space. This is about the size of a large snow globe and easily fits on a small end table, so finding a place for this shouldn't be too hard.

I Bought 2 of these New Echo Speakers to Fill my FIRE TV 4K Viewing experience with a touch of a button or a simple voice control. BUT, when I played MUSIC VIDEOS through these, which I have set-up as Stereo Home Theater speakers, THEY BLEW MY MIND!Mind you, I am a professional Music Producer, Mix Engineer and Music Video Director, so SOUND does matter VERY much to me. When I fired these speakers up, before hearing them, I thought I'd eventually need the Echo Sub to match them up, boy was I wrong.These sound so amazing when watching Music Videos, that there is No Need for the Sub. Once you adjust the EQ for these Speakers on the Alexa App, you'll hear EXCACTLY what I mean.Bottom Line, I absolutely Recommend these, as a Pair, for your Big Screen 4K TV watching Experience.

What can I say, it’s an Amazon Echo! What I was surprised by was that even though I purchased in black, the electrical cord and plug are white! All of my echo devices in past (all ordered in black) had black cords. Come on Amazon, a cool black spherical Echo with a white tail for an electrical cord… really? Wouldn’t have changed my decision to buy during holiday prime sale but would have been nice to either have option for black cord or at least have noted in description that regardless of color ordered the cord is white.

I see that the big ball has great reviews but I think it might be from people who have never had an Alexa device before or they strictly use this for playing music. I have had the 2nd generation Echo dot, the hockey puck looking one for over 2 years and it has worked great for talking to it and music very crisp and clear and it picks up my voice very well (hears good) and responds. Now I see this new one the 4th generation big ball with a 3 inch speaker that is supposed to give great quality sound which it does sound very good for what it is playing music but the downfall vs the 2nd generation Dot is even with the bass turned down and the treble turned up when she talks it is not crisp and clear, it has a muffled sound making it hard to hear her with any background noise like tv going at same time, so that is annoying and the big ball doesn't hear very well, sometimes not hearing what I said at all and other times she is lit up listening but not answering at all so have to ask again and again very disturbing.  I am going to keep the ball and plug in when I want music but continue to use the Echo Dot 2nd generation for all the talking to her throughout the day at least this one hears and answers back almost always and the sound for talking is so much clearer and crisp.

I was under the impression I was purchasing the premium sound with a clock.  I really wanted the clock as this device was for our master and was intended to be our alarm clock.  Would’ve been perfect if I’d gotten the one with the clock (probably a mis-communication with the Kohls employee who got it out of the case for me) and not a fault of the product itself.

Not sure why this Echo product is hard of hearing but it is. I have an older dot thirty feet away in the bathroom that responds more than this one in a very central location of my living room + kitchen.Also, the issue with Amazon devices playing Amazon music for three songs then stopping has not been addressed for years, I even pay more for the unlimited music sub.Other than constantly yelling to get this to hear me and playing three songs….Shrugs.I expected more for what I paid for this.

It’s a cool concept and I don’t know if mine is defective but it loses connection a lot. I know it’s not my internet because all of my other devices are fine. It will also just randomly crank up my music with no rhyme or reason. I checked and there’s no set schedule or routine for it to do that, it just does it. It gets what I say a lot of the time but sometimes I’ll say something crystal clear and it will not understand, even through it’s a direction I’ve given it before without issue. Sometimes it randomly shuts off but my phone app shows it’s connected and there’s nothing in the settings or routine to make it do that. The routines you can set only allow one “skill” per routine which is inconvenient. It could definitely use a lot of improvement and a cool feature would be options for different celebrity voices (like how WAZE does), not having to ask Alexa to ask a specific celebrity something to get their voice. It would also be nice if, not only would it turn on my tv by voice, but if it would also launch sling or paramount + or discovery + by voice too.  Accents, celebrity voices, better connectivity, more consistency, and the ability to search all of your streaming services for a specific movie or show you ask for, as well as record them if you’d ask it to would make it worth the price. As it is, kind of a rip off. If you really want one, get the dot. The price is more inline with what you get. The concept is great but a lot of room for improvement.

I am extremely happy with my new Echo Plus (4th Gen).  It replaces my Echo Plus (3rd Gen).  It was very easy to set, up and it immediately recognized all my existing peripherals, primarily lights and plugs.Regarding the sound quality, my wife and I both agree that it is significantly better than it was with the 3rd generation.And I don’t understand the complaints about the treble and supposedly weak bass.  The new Echo Plus is sitting on my desk while I’m writing this review, and the bass makes my desk vibrate, so I’m going to turn down the bass.And the people complaining about the color of the power cord?  Sheesh!  What a ridiculous complaint!  And let’s face it, regardless of the color of the cord, people would have complained: “<fill in any color>?  What a ridiculous color for a power cord!  It doesn’t match my décor!”I highly recommend the Echo Plus (4th Gen).

There's isn't much to dislike about this speaker. It works as advertised and the sound quality is very good.But... I purchased this at $99.99 and 3 days later there was a $20 price drop. I contacted Amazon to get a credit for the difference. No dice. I asked them are you really going to make order another one at the lower price and return the other one just so I can get get the price difference? In the end handling an unnecessary return will only cost you more money.  No dice.When the new one  is delivered (already ordered) I will not even open it,  I'll just return it. So I'll get the $20+tax difference on my credit card once the return arrives and amazon will have to incur extra costs of handling the return. What a dumb policy, when all they had to do was issue a credit.

I received an Echo Dot for my birthday. The family loved using it especially for music. So I decided to get my wife the Echo hub for Christmas since it was supposed to have better sound quality. It has not disappointed. The sound is loud and clear, and the bass quality is great without sounding hollow like my Dot can at times. Integrating it with our other devices is great it unlocked so many other uses. Really looking forward to learning all the functions it can do to make our lives more fun and convenient.

I have the small dot in the kitchen and I wanted to find something with humph when listening to music. The dot was not kicking it for me. This right here gives the bass reflex I was looking for.

The sound bounces off the walls in the right way it sounds like I have large speakers. Couldn’t be more happy.

This is the fifth different model of Amazons echoes we have had in our home. It has the best sound of any other previous models and seems to have better voice recognition in response. My only issue with it is it looks extremely stupid sitting on my counter. It looks like it’s a child’s bowling ball plugged into the wall. I understand that Amazon tries to be creative. But I’m not sure why this thing had to be a sphere. I definitely won’t be replacing any of my other older units with this model. I can’t stand to look at it. Maybe I’ll get a cover for it so I can dress it up like a cantaloupe.

Edit: Figured out the original issue, thank you reddit.  Now she works when she feels like it. Sometimes I'm 5 feet away and slowly raising my voice I get now responses to only a few moment later the TV says her name, and she starts having a conversation.  Other times she speaks quick gibberish to which my partner and I question our sanity, but mostly she throws out random facts then apologizes she's still learning. Which brings me to the next part.  She randomly dings, and blue ring glows for a few moments then done.  Totally random  and mostly at very quiet times.  Otherwise it's handy in a facts argument.I wish I could say this echo is great, or this thing sucks, but since I can’t fully use it because the Alexa App is the most discouraging, frustrating, EVIL, POS ever created! After 4 days of research I have resolved to just let the echo collect dust bunnies, and be a “think piece “ of “art”, the thinking part is Why did I buy this junk?! I have lived in the United States my entire life. My cell phone, smart TVs, and any other smart product I’ve ever own, have all been set to US English since day 1, I have never been anywhere where I’ve ordered anything to be shipped to another country. My Amazon apps, Spotify, YouTube,hulu, etc, are all set to US English. I do not own a vpn, BUT, BUT, BUT THE ALEXA APP Home Screen looks normal for me, English and everything, but try ANY link within the app, and BOOM SPANISH!! WTF?! And YES, I’ve tried everything freaking thing the internet, Amazon, geek squad, neighbor, the dog has recommended and Still royally and totally….well you know where this is going. F You Amazon App Developers you suck!

My dot Echo can do so many things. It can give me the time, set an alarm, a reminder, tell me an interesting fact, or tell me how my days going to go. I have the unlimited Amazon music app, so I can play any music I want on my echo. You are limited to what you can play, if you don’t get the app. My echo is in charge of my TV. There’s so many things I can do. I don’t know what I would do without mine.

Currently I use two of these full size echoes and one dot to get full house audio that is seemless when walking from room to room. I love being able to have a party with GREAT audio and just that little detail of continuity like you'd get from an expensive multi room setup without any of the setup nightmare.The reason I have these over the dots is the pure bass. This thing rattles my walls like no other similarly priced/sized speaker can and you are really getting a lot of bang for your buck. Love these so much and highly recommend!

In short; she works well when she hears you... like talking to your hard of hearing grandmother.. I have to say her name a couple times for her to respond.I have owned almost every version of the echo dot. I thought it was time to buy a real Echo for better sound quality, and so I have bought this round version of Alexa.. I love the design, and she does work well - easily connects to my apps, and other Bluetooth items, but her voice recognition seems to not be on par. None of the other Echo items I’ve owned had this issue including the 3 dots I still have installed around my home.Not sure if others are having similar issues (I have not read any review yet).

This was given as a Christmas gift , I asked her to please write what she thinks and here is the review :I am pleased beyond with the Echo Speaker The sound quality is crisp and clear. The many useful features it has are a huge plus. The one that I find extremely useful is it will let you know if someone is trying to enter your home by the sound of breaking glass or banging, this in today's changing world is a must have. I am still exploring with it and each time I do I find something that allows me to enjoy the unit much more. Music and the sound of my voice, weather and news  without turning on the TV and the rapid responses are amazing. Whoever designed this unit had me in mind :0)

I'd have preferred a color matched power supply,  but that's not performance based.  The sound is great, and it works as a hub for my ""smart bulbs""  but it seems to forget how to reconnect to my network for lighting routines to work properly.  I've had to remove and rediscover my lights a few times and i've only had this thing a couple weeks.I's say it's more app related, but they are intertwined.  Manually turning the smart lights on with the app worked fine today, and vocal on/off worked but the routine created did not.  prior to  adding the light to a ""group"" the routine worked.  i have to remove the light and the group and start over because i haven't found out how to remove a specific light from a  ""group"" to try it again.

I'm using three 4th generation echos as a sound system in the upstairs bedroom/bathroom combo. Because of Amazon's design, all I had to do was turn them each on and place them in the same ""group"" in the Alexa app. Now they work with my Soundbar, my TV, and my computer.The sound quality is very good, especially considering the overall price and variety of functions an Echo has. And I can experience stereo sound in the bedroom while watching a movie, or I can listen to a podcast when cleaning, folding laundry, or getting ready for work. Plus do things like, turn on/off lights, lock the front door, set the HVAC, or send a voice message downstairs instead of shouting (or getting my text left unread by the young ones).They're useful and fun. Exactly what I want out of a gadget.

 Not good at responding to voice commands at all. Bass is good, almost too good, because you miss other sounds because it’s heavy. Design is bulky and catches constant dust.Worst of all, it now makes the sound in the video attached randomly and loudly.Woke up to it this morning. Only way to stop is to unplug for a while and replug. Not sure who to call and they don’t make it easy. Guess once the warranty runs out it’s designed to be a large paperweight?Note:First review was denied. Not sure what I did wrong since they won’t tell you that part but I’m assuming it was because I compared to other products they make and sell. It was all truth and no bad language or links. So it was either that or they don’t like bad reviews on their products. People need to know this stuff to make an informed decision.

Just follow the 3 steps and let Alexa do the rest!  I was playing music, asking for news headlines, and weather within 5-min from opening the box!  Very basic with + for high volume - for low volume.  I asked Alexa to stop playing music and it immediately stopped!  There is an App that goes through many things this Echo can do!  The sound is okay and am sure with other added components, would be even better but wanted to start with one item as a ‘test’ and it passed!  Similar items that I’ve tried were not as User Friendly and no matter what source of music, there were technical difficulties beyond my patience.  I halfway expected this to be no better but turned out to be way better!!!  If you’re looking for quick and supper easy, this is it!

I have had a Google Home Mini and it was nothing short of a device with the IQ about 3 points above a rock.  Ask it a simple question and it would only reply it did not have that information at this time.  Waste of money.Then comes along the Echo and it blows away the Google Home Mini.  I have only had mine for about 2 weeks and I am still learning what it can do, but thus far, I am happy with it.  I am sure I won't learn everything the Echo does, or will do in the future with updated, but for now, it is doing so much more than the GHM.  I am happy I unplugged my old piece that was taking up space with the Echo.I was happy enough with the Echo in such a short time, I got the Echo Dot to put in the bedroom too.

First, I could not use my desktop computer to link the echo to Alexa. I had to load the Alexa app onto my phone to do this and I do not like a lot of apps on my phone.  Second, and I'm not sure if it's because I have the volume up on the echo, the sound goes out on occasion, like a hiccup. I've tried unplugging, waiting then plugging back in, but that didn't help.  And finally, the echo seems to move across the table I have it on over several days use.  I have to keep moving it back into place.  The sound is not as good as I expected, being listed as ""premium"", but it is passable.  The unit is acceptable over all, but not exceptional or special.

We bought this Echo to replace our first edition Echo.  Our old one got a bit hard of hearing, although she was still fit in all other ways.This Echo is what we wanted - she responds the first time we say things.  It was simple to set up and all our old settings worked immediately, as one comes to expect from an amazon device.  We have not yet tried to set it up as a hub, but we did want that flexibility in the future.She already integrates with the same smart devices the old Alexa recognized, and that's all we need at the moment.  Since this new hub will not send alerts to our sirens, we can't use it to replace our home security hub.We are sold on the Amazon echoes of all sizes and were not disappointed in this new one.

Combined this with the battery base, and the two seem to work very well together for moving into the yard.  I'm not sure that the sound is any better, or even equal, to the previous Echo versions.  The unit certainly isn't as responsive to voice commands.  Where the other units responded quickly, with this one we have to raise our voices, get closer, and often repeat the wake command before it responds.  Altogether a mixed review as to whether this is an advancement, or a step back.  Not sure what Amazon was doing here.  Doesn't seem to have been a leap forward in any way.  Just an upsell.  But we fell for it, for the portability factor (which used to be satisfied by the Tap, which is no longer supported -- hmmmm).  Make your own judgements.

You could correct a little with the app but never got to the quality of the original we had.Another big factor for our change was the mic on our 1st gen just wasn’t as responsive after all these years and we found ourselves always yelling at Alexa. However, when we set up this new Gen 4 Echo we found it performed worse than the original. So much so, that the Gen 4 sphere would ignore our commands while the G1 which we moved to a further room away was still picking up our commands.  I’d fault a good bit of this to placement location of the two units, as it’s a little close to a tv but I’m doing an apples to apples comparison of the two different units in the same spot under the same lifestyle home conditions.  We gave it about 14 days of testing before we gave up and decided to return.Also, I’m not sure the spherical design is really any better stylistically or practically. It seems to take up more space and having the light ring on the bottom means you can’t really tell when Alexa is actually hearing your commands.  We ended up repeating ourselves quite often because she just wasn’t acknowledging we were speaking to her. Plus from a volume control standpoint the ring can no longer provide a visual queue as you can’t see all the way around the sphere. Obviously you can ask Alexa what her setting is volume wise, but sometimes you just want to see.Lastly, we bought a blue one. It’s neat that it’s not black like all of our other echoes and dots. But, the exact shade of blue actually wasn’t that appealing once we had it in our house.  It’s almost like they couldn’t decide which shade of blue to use so they just went with blah in the end.Biggest Pro:  I like the idea of the new colors.Biggest Cons: sound quality and mic sensitivityExtra note - we did link it with the multi room sound playback and that feature was easy enough to set up and integrated our G1 Echo with this G4 Echo seamlessly.  It also pointed out more sound flaws though as the G1 outperformed in the end with providing a more dynamic and balanced room filling sound.

Alexa is awesome!  I have my coffee pot and a lamp plugged into Smart Plugs.  I just say, Alexa, turn on the kitchen, and she makes the coffee before I'm out of bed!!  She tells jokes, says hello when I come home, and switches the light off or on at my command.  I'm adding an Echo Show soon that will offer fabulous features!

It’s not as small and lanky as the original tower but it has its perks. It’s cool blue color and spaceship like ring that glows from the bottom when a notification arrives, makes it more appealing.  It still has the same great sound and hooks up to Bluetooth.  It doesn’t listen as intently as the tower did. At least I don’t see it turning on when it thinks I said it’s name.  Overall, I like it and it’s not such an eyesore either.

I have always wanted an Alexa since my cousin had one and it seemed pretty cool and the fact that you can get a light that pairs with it. Alexa is good to wake up to because you could add custom commands. I have airpods but sometimes I dont want to wear them so I ask Alexa to play music she plays the music I wanted and there is no problems I have overcame for now. Really great my brother loves it also. Thank you Amazon !

Sometimes if the volume is loud it’s hard to get Alexa to hear you. There’s a lot of skills that need to be removed or updated from the system. There should be more voice options available. I want Alexa to be able to take my voice and use it. (Think Ursula from the little mermaid)Oh yeah, Alexa is 3x better the assistant than Siri in every way. And I’m stuck with apple.

Not sure that my review will be much different from so many other positive reviews. I traded in an Echo Gen 3 to upgrade. I don't claim to be an audiophile but the sound does seem crisper and a little deeper. I also find that it's picking up my voice a little better than the older model. Obviously I love having the Echo for all the usual reasons... Easy to stream music from multiple services; reminders REALLY help to fill in the blanks of my poor memory; routines are pretty easy to create - and useful - once you get the hang of it. I can't say that's it's an essential to have but I think once you do have one you never want to get rid of it!! PLUS, the 25% price discount + the $30 trade in credit made this a no brainer upgrade!

I LOVE THIS DEVICE:It plays everything I want it to.  It has features & extra voices -  I never could have imagined.The sound quality is EXCELLENT.HOWEVER:  Like Siri - This technology needs to adapt to hear the user all the way through a request.In both cases (as I have on my Iphone),,  when you pause for a split second - only to have the device run from there - then you're on a continual repeat repeat request cycle until you can tell it what you want, WITHOUT any pause.  THIS IS EXTREMELY ANNOYING ON BOTH PLATFORMS.  I wish there was a ""few second lag"" built into EITHER device...as we all don't speak monotone and without pause.Thank you, Since my complaint is universal, this device is top notch above it's peers.

I replaced an echo dot (2nd gen) plugged into a Bose Color Soundlink speaker with this new Echo.  Sound is significantly improved, which was the primary reason for purchasing.  The Unit is on a living room end table and I notice that when I crouch down to the level of the Echo, the treble is much crisper.  I think the two treble speakers should have been placed higher so that they could emit sound more vertically.  This is my only negative comment about the unit.  Everything else is similar to the Dot it replaced and seems to work as expected.  If you're not as picky as I am about the sound, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this product.  (Great bass, by the way!)  UPDATE: I've since read other reviewers comment about Echo-4 being hard-of-hearing.  I have to agree.

I was surprised at the distance that it could hear my speaking to get it to wake. Set up was easy and I like how the app is set up. My issue was we wanted it so my grandma could call people and you have to say the contacts exactly right for it to work. It wouldn’t recognize the name Liz no matter how we tried saying it. It also will not work if you have linked contacts. It was also not easy to clarify after the fact which of that first name. You have to give the whole contact name and even then it would confuse it.

I have the larger cylindrical echo at another residence, so I decided to try this smaller new one in my primary home. I'm very pleased with everything it can do. I wish it had a little more high end (treble). You can adjust treble, mid and bass with the app or voice recognition. Obviously, it has it's limitations because of its' size. But all in all, I'm very pleased with it and am still learning all the navigation possibilities both with voice and on the app. I also purchased several smart bulbs and cameras that I am going to try and control with Alexa. I'm am especially pleased with the price I received on Prime Days.

It is stylish..  can attach to a wall.  has a different holder it takes more space..  for me that is important. detects what I am saying...  if speaker is facing me.Sound I cannot tell difference for sure but believe this is slightly tinier . Sound is subjective.all in all I prefer the plus.  because it is smaller and hears me no matter what direction it is facing..That is why plus is in the house center and Echo 4th gen is in a corner facing to where some on might me..Plus controls echo per my settings and it works great that waylike stereo thru the house.  I have a dot in 1 bedroom  too.It has its place.. if you have the space.

The device was great until about a week ago. Now whenever you ask for a song or playlist, it automatically adds “other similar songs” and there is no way to disable this. You may get the song you want and you may not. It’s a crap shoot at best. It’s really made the Echo a frustrating device. I wish Amazon would just put it back the way it was.

The sound out of this ball shaped echo is surprisingly good with nice deep bass.  The mic seems to pic up voice commands less than previous echo devices. I have an echo studio and echo dots in adjacent rooms, and they will pick up commands before this echo even when standing right next to it.This echo also struggles with multi-room audio requests, almost always playing on the single device rather than on the multi-room group.Aside from that, setup is a breeze like all other echo devices purchased.  I even with the flaws, I liked it enough to buy a second unit for another room.

first one lasted 5 months so only 3 stars until I see if it lasts longer.  Return under warranty was a huge hassle.  Bought it on sale but reimbursement was for that price not replacement price.  Since it only lasted 5 months, should get the replacement for the price paid.  After much time on the phone with Amazon, they finally got it right.  liked the ring on the older version being on top better than this one that has it on the bottom, not a easy to see.

If you're looking for QUALITY sound... much better than a Dot, not as good as a Studio.Honestly, I've owned this Dot Gen 4, the Echo Gen 4, the Echo Studio and none are really giving me what a good amp, good speakers do. A single source, stereo, even 360 degree, it just isn't happening with any Echo, Hype.Just ok sound, connectivity if not easily paired or set up, an Echo may fit your needs. Or your childs. Setting up multiple Echos for stereo pairs, the message I get, ""this device is not compatible, the proceed further ""next"", grayed out. With the Echo or the Echo Studio. But perhaps that's just me.UPDATE: HERE'S WHY I COULDN'T SET UP STEREO PAIRS between an Echo and my Studio. After a very polite and in one way helpful call(helped me set up a temp sensor Routine) with a very knowledgable Amazon tech support(thanks Chris L) about connecting Echos, Echo Studio in stereo pairs,""ONLY ALLOWS STEREO PAIRS OF LIKE DEVICES"". MEANING: NOT AN ECHO AND A STUDIO. NOT AN ECHO DOT AND AN ECHO. NOT AN ECHO STUDIO WITH AN ECHO.... LIKE DEVICES, EXACTLY. YOU CAN SET UP MULTI ROOM DEVICES THAT WILL THEN PLAY TOGETHER, NOT IN STEREO PAIRS.I'm told.WHAAAAAAT?????Temperature Sensor- a big reason to buy but it just doesn't perform, react to changes in temp fast enough to make this feature worth while. The sensor being ""in"" the Echo enclosure is heavily influenced by the enclosure temp itself(and everything inside). A big/rapid change in temp? the enclosure keeps the Echo from implementing in real time. Have a heater connected? Think this is great to turn on/off by temp? Very slow to respond to either a temp drop in the room(then it turns on the heater in a created routine) and then responds very slowly to turn the heater off when ""off"" routine temp is reached. Seems to me this is a case of an external temp sensor, not in the Echo enclosure would work much better. I tried it, just toooo slow to respond and I deleted the routines.

I bought 2 then quickly bought a 3rd one a few days later. I now have music all over my home. The sound coming out is very good.I'm not very tech savy but learning everyday how to set it up for me. Amazon and Alexa sends me more information on what it can do. I appreciate the information.

Last echo I used was the v2 echo plus I think it was called. The sound seems a little better and you can adjust the bass and treble and such which is nice. Voice recognition seems about the same. Not terrible, but you will have moments that it doesnt catch quite what you say, but if you get into the habit of practicing annunciation a bit it gets better. Love that it connects to my Spotify. Also makes using smart home products easy and fun. For sure its alot bigger than you expect, but not oversized. One con I would say for me is i wish the buttons were closer to the front, but thats where the speakers are. maybe a bigger base with an edge that slants out forward in the front or something. However this con is not a deal breaker. Overall I would recommend as great smart home hub/assistant.

Bought two of these to pair for stereo sound and wall mount in my grand living room dining room combo. Bought the wall mounts and extension cables so all in for a little over $200. They sound great together, actually better than I had hoped. Full bass and great stereo sound. On sale for $79 a piece you actually can’t beat this device as a smart hub and speaker combo. Sounds a lot fuller mounted on the wall than just a sitting on a table. Sounds better as a stereo pair too. I have echos all over my house and love combining them for multi-room music when we entertain. I now have these in the front of the house and an echo dot hooked up to my family room surround sound and I sync them together and have great full sounding music playing through-out my entire 1st floor.

Nice improvement in the sound quality vs the 1st Gen echo which I own. Howvet the design is not so great. Fine the volume, command and microphone buttons are slight raised so you can feel them in the dark but would have preferred that the ring light was somewhere at the top as it would make it easier to see the knobs in the night.It is cerntanly much heavier with the improved speakers. It certainly takes up a larger footprint which I'm not keen about but looks more like a decorative item rather than the obvious look of a speaker when compared to the 1st Gen Echo.

I love this alexa so much! So so so much. GREAT speaker and bass, shes pretty smart its nice to use her as a dictionary. Telling her to add things to my list, remind me of something, set timers, give her a list of events, linked her to my spotify so I can tell her to play my liked songs, ask for the weather every morning. She even tells you what time it is, how long itll take to get from home to work, call your phone if you lose it or call anyone in general. I love the drop in option as well and that i can call it wherever I am and pop in on my 5 yr old son when I'm gone. The alexa app is easy to use too! Idk how I ever lived without this.

You can also link all other Echos in the home so that you can announce dinner time, etc for kids and family. Got ours on sale and it was worth every penny !

The sound is very good but I don’t know if it is that much better than the Echo Pluses I have. The voice recognition is poorer than any of the echoes I have had (from the original to the plus), it doesn’t do well when other sounds are in the room. This unit was placed where I had one of my Echo Pluses, the Echo pluses never had an issue but this one has had problems multiple times (I don’t play it very loud either). This needs to be addressed before the next model or people will go elsewhere. I do like the looks of it but it needs a little work.

I have the 1st generation Echo and decided I wanted to expand Alexa to the whole apartment, so I bought this latest generation.  It performs great, totally eclipsing the first generation device, which is still an excellent device.

Set up was simple and quick.  There really aren't any negatives in overall performance.

I really wanted to like the new Echo 4.And for sound quality is actually amazing. It's on par with a much more expensive speaker.But as an Echo device, It's actually worse than my echo 3 dot was.For some reason it barely recognizes my voice. So I need to call out the command word 2 to 3 times each time to get its attention.It also has some really eonky integration issues.For example every time I use it to control my fire TV it changes the size of the fire TV buttons and I have to reset the thing.I really wanted to like this and I thought it should have been a nice upgrade when my echo three dot stopped working. But instead it's somehow inferior on all of the Alexa parts, Even though the sound quality is really good.

So, the pros: super easy setup & much improved sound. it’s not a Bose mind you, but sooo much better over the echo dots I replaced it with - it actually has some bass :-) I'm happy with it. Cons: like my kids, it does not listen worth a damn. Since I have had it, several times my echo dot in another room, behind a wall, responded where this thing just gave me a dumb look - what gives? And the shape... I mean I guess its ok... I get it, maybe they are trying to give the thing a little pizazz (shoulder shrug) but why is the light ring on the bottom? You kinda need to put it up on something to see it. But what? So I have been scouring through pages of crystal ball stands - Ha! Wish me luck!

This is not a compensated comment. Multiple verified purchase. This is a great product, just because it has a built in Zigbee hub it deserves a good look. It is a little overpriced, and it should be offered at a lower price. That would make it the perfect device. Like everything else is not perfect but it does what I need it to do. Everything else to me is a bonus, good sound, excellent features, if you don't mind having a ball looking thing on your counter or desk it will do a lot for you. I have 2 upstairs and downstairs and I transferred all my devices to them I have not experience any disconnects so far. I would recommend this product.

Overall, the voice recognition is very good, and the sound is amazing for speakers this size. I have an Amazon Music subscription, and you'd think Alexa's search capabilities would be accurate and precise. It's not.

The algorithm should allow branching questions to get to the right content.

I added this latest echo to my other 2 to get better music in my kitchen. The system is very good but there are three consistent annoyances I have with it:1. I can't stand the confirmation tone Alexa uses. I know it can't be changed (yet?) but this needs to be fixed ASAP. I'd rather nothing at all or a more pleasant tone I choose.2. When it comes to music, Alexa seems to be confused all the time. I find it very difficult to have all my speakers play at once. I have to add the phrase Everywhere or Everywhere group to my choice. Annoying at best.3. Alexa keeps moving around my system when it comes to the most rapid response time when I say the wake up word. I find this annoying as well.

I love this but why have they not made it chargeable so it can be portable. It just seems like a waste people are on the move and take things like this with them. I like mine in the kitchen but sometimes I take it outside when I’m working in the yard or barbecuing. Have to plug it in especially when a plug isn’t available (outside at the patio table) sucks. I did buy a battery base from a third party vender so mine is now portable and I love it. I just don’t understand how I’m this day and age it isn’t already an all in one. Come on Amazon get with the times make this thing chargeable. So we don’t have to piecemeal it together. This would be 5 stars if it wasn’t for this issue.

This is my second Echo and it replaces a dot. The sound quality is MUCH better than the dot. Since I use it to make phone calls the sound quality for the people I call is important. So far so good with very few complaints. And listening to voice radio programs is EXCELLENT; very nice to listen to for my aging ears. The niggles are few, but they are there.  It is BIG! It also prefers that one speaks directly to it. This is a small inconvenience since it is to my right, not directly in front of me, when I make phone calls and the people I call ask me to repeat myself.  Oh well, a small 'price' to pay. And YES,  I highly recommend this item... Especially when it is on special!

We had a difficult time trying to install the product and it took three calls to different support staff to get the job done.

Came with a 30 day free trial of Amazon Music Unlimited which is a paid service.  Unless I upgrade to a family plan I can't stream music in more than one area but for a little bit extra per month I can stream 6 places at once.  Still considering to stay on Unlimited.

I use other speakers for sound so that isn’t a thing to me.  We do use it constantly for our curtains, lights, fans, etc.  The white cord is ridiculous.  The form factor is neat but makes the blue light more difficult to see.Setup was difficult.  It glitched on the first go and so the app kept looping to “setup your new echo device despite having set it up 5 times.  I reset it and started over. The light now lights up.It doesn’t hear me any better or get the commands correct more frequently than the previous generation.  I constantly get “x device doesn’t support that” followed by the command being carried out the next time I say it.  It integrates horribly with my firetv stick (so did the previous generation) where “launch Hulu on firetv” gives me a 50/50 split of “that skill is not enabled” and “launching Hulu on firetv”.I have 3 alexas in 3 different rooms spanning about 2000 square feet.  The microphones are too good so more often than not 2/3 of them hear the wake word and (I guess?) assume the other one will follow out the command so neither does it.  The new Alexa asked me yesterday if I was talking to it or a different Alexa.  I corrected it but it hasn’t helped anything.The only positive here is that when it gets a command right, specifically with SmartThings, it is a little faster.Our echo does not sit directly under the tv.  It would be neat if the echo would work for as read sound or atmos sound for your tv.  It does not.  It will only work as a tv speaker with our firetv stick which means the sound comes out from a weird place in our room.*****Update****. It’s garbage.  I have to yell for it to hear me and when it does, it ignores my command or gets it completely wrong;  “I’m sorry, X device doesn’t support that” randomly only to work perfectly the next time.  The microphone is worse than the firetv cubes by 10.  The old microphone was so much better.  If I could return this I would.  If you want better sound get an Echo Studio or SONOS instead.Update 2: If I wasn’t so lazy I’d go find our old one in the basement.  This thing doesn’t hear me, ignores me…seems to hear me then ignores me.  What the heck happened here?  Who thought this was a good idea?  How is this 5 stars?Space heaters and fans defeat this. Worried about Alexa hearing your conversations? Just turn on your ceiling fan or a space heater.  FYI- The Sonos/Alexa in our garage works with 2 industrial fans blowing at high speed 4 ft away from it.

its a great device but like most devices its has a few cons. sometimes it doesn't respond to you to requests and you have to unplug it and plug it back in , then its fine. sometimes it acknowledges your request but does nothing. for example the other day i kept saying ""alexa, play pop songs"". it responded saying playing todays hits but played nothing. i had to reboot it and then its fine. Overall its a great device. its super loud and the bass is great. Apart from the few mentioned cons its a really nice gadget.

Until now, all I had was an echo dot and a Google mini.  Wanted better sound, most reviews said Echo was better than Nest.... Both were on sale for similar price, Echo came with free trial of Amazon music, so I went with Echo.  Very happy, sound is great, much better than dot or mini.  Pleased with Amazon music as well.  Might get a few more dots or Echos to do some grouping to really fill the house with music.

Unit works as advertised, a little disappointment that some, for example FEIT electric require a ""helper"" app on my phone for Alexa control, while others, i.e. some lights from Home Depot appear to have ""native"" alexa support baked in, much better. Long story short, not everything that says it works with alexa does it in a truely native manner ... Guess you got to read the fine print ...

I had one of the original Echo devices from when they very first came out. I was fortunate enough to be one of the early owners. It’s been pretty good. I mean…she gets a little mixed up sometimes. Our whole home is integrated with Alexa. Lights, thermostats, plugs, garage door, door locks…you name it. Mostly, we really like it. We use it every day. I love the shopping list most of all but I also like walking into a room and turning on lights or the tv with my voice. I really enjoy changing the temperature without picking up my phone. Love it. I hear Amazon is losing a ton of money on these things so I guess I can see why the quality is going down.We finally upgraded to this new orb because our really old tube style Alexa was getting very hard of hearing. I hate this new one. It’s garbage. I’ll ask a question and she loudly yells at me. The volume is currently set to 3. I’ll ask her the temperature moments later and I can’t hear her but barely. I cannot find a fix for this. I’m just over it.

I have had 3 of these along with a subwoofer for almost 2.5 years now.  All I can say is DO NOT BUY.  I mean it do not do it.  You will be sorry.  It has been nothing but a constant hassle.  Nothing works as advertised.  Even after spending hours and hours and hours of time with customer service over years and years.  There are bugs that I reported over 2 years ago that still are not fixed.  Trying to use a stereo pair, forget it.  After over 5 hours with customer service my ""Stereo Pair"" only plays with one speaker.  This is only ONE example of of the problems I have had.  I have spent hours upon hours with their customer service.  I am immensely unhappy with this hardware and software.  It is a constant battle to keep things paired and working.  Phillips Hue lights that work just fine with the Phillips Hue app don't work in Alexa.  Their customer service tries to say it's the light.  Seriously, the light works with anything other than Alexa and yet their answer is that it's the light.  Again, just one more example of many, I mean many of the issues I have had.I am not kidding when I tell you that today I had had enough.  I got so mad I took all 3 of my echo devices outside and took a hammer to them.  I am not joking.  I will go to Best Buy today and buy a couple of Google Smart Speakers.Stay away form Echo and Fire TV.  They are full of bugs that Amazon is just never going to fix.

I've heard some say they didn't like the sound. I think it's great personally and I'm picky. The bass is so rich I can literally feel it reverberate across my desk an onto my keyboard as I type this. Out of the box it was too strong, and highs too muddled. But I turned bass wayy down and treble way up (but not all the way up which I usually have to do with cheaper speakers) and now it's great. Even turned down the bass is still rich and smooth, the sign of a good woofer. The size is a bit awkward but I think that's necessary to get that woofer in there...and also I like that it's less tall that the old echo because it doesn't block a secondary monitor that I have off to the side on my desk. The blue color is great too!

I am new to Echo group and Alexa and this is my first Echo.  It has a long legacy of experience recognizing human voice and uses AI to reach the best answers.  I have many Play Lists in my Amazon-Music which can be played by simply specifying which playlist to play and how long.  It is also useful to track my Amazon order.  I enjoy making new routines to perform various tasks by one command word. Sound quality is acceptable though it falls short of Bose mini soundlink.  Unfortunately it does not work as a Blue tooth speaker.  Instruction to use the device is designed for those who has experience with previous Echo but it is difficult to follow Alexa app.  When used with a voice command plug, I can control my bedside lamp.  Hope I can expand the use of Echo through out house.

I really like the sound of the 4th gen echo compared the my second gen, but the microphones seems less perceptive (can you hear me Alexa?)  and there is a slight lag in Alexa response I didn’t notice in my previous echo. The music sounds rich and full. There is also a aux-in which is useful for playing my old iPod or CDs. That said, I bought a Bluetooth transmitter which works well too. The form factor is a little funky, but I’m now used to it. l. I have the echo sitting next to a smaller glowing globe of the universe.  And my portable CD player looks like a flying saucer, so there you go. Functionally, the echo also works with the Alexa remote, which can be useful. I haven tried the smart hub yet. All in all a worthwhile upgrade.

We love the sound of our new Echo! Great voice recognition as well. We bought this as another WiFi speaker for a home office space. While I don’t like the look of it as much as the last version of the Echo (which we also own), the sound is excellent.My big knock on this particular product was one small detail that does not affect the performance, but it seams to make me wonder where else they cut corners. Our Charcoal Echo came with a bright white cord and outlet. I know complaining about this seams petty but they offer it in different colors for a reason and we bought it to put on a black shelf in our home office and the white cord makes it look like they just skipped details. Silly, yes, but it makes a difference.

I was already impressed by the ability of our single Echo 3rd generation in our living room to pick up Alexa voice commands all over the house but was curious to see what Amazon could have improved with the 4th general. Since I needed to improve my Alexa infrastructure in the cottage, I went ahead and tested the dual ""stereo"" arrangement using two 4th gen Echos and wow! The sound is not ""sound system"" quality but it definitely made the upgrade worth it at the cottage where a complete sound system is not required.

As a speaker, this is pretty good.  I like the Alexa control.  But I bought it to play my CDs on a stereo and have them play throughout the house (on 4 Echo Dots).  It took a little work to play the Line-In on the Echo, but as soon as I tried to play in on the ""Everywhere"" network, it dropped the Line -In and played from from Amazon Music.  I looked on some posts and found other complaints and questions.  LINE-IN DOES NOT WORK ON ANYTHING BUT THE ECHO WITH THE CONNECTION!  Don't get this if you think it will work as the description implies.  It can play the Line-In on the Echo, and it can play music to multiple Echo speakers, but IT CAN'T DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME (and they do not say this).

I bought this to replace an old Echo Dot...the price was good ($40 off) and I wanted a device that would work as a hub. This fit the bill. It sounds great! Looks good!

Aaah, the Alexa Echo....  I found the sound quality is definitely NOT as clear, loud as my first Echo purchase, which is unavailable for reorder.  Amazon doesn’t plan on producing the 2nd generation tall version which was excellent all around!!  Tech support could NOT help.  For this 4th generation Round Ball shaped Echo there are flaws.  Very frequently Alexa does Not respond to my voice.  Need to repeat command about three times before she responds.  Tech support could Not fix this flaw.  Sometimes the sound quality is muffled a bit so to be unclear.  The ball-shape makes it difficult to move around.  Fear of it falling out of hand is great.  I Do Not like this one as compared to my first Echo that died six months AFTER warranty expired

I had the very first echo dot, and for good sound (music, etc.) I had to bluetooth to a bigger speaker. The round HD design is like night and day, even without an external speaker. I also got the wall mount, which enhances sound because it doesn’t get absorbed into what the speaker is sitting on. I do notice that you have to speak more directly AT the unit, not just to it from anywhere in the room - but it’s a minor adjustment.

I was looking forward for the new 4th generation Alexa: promised better sound, better home integration, nice looking!  I bought the device to replace my 2nd generation Alexa device that we use in the kitchen/breakfast area.The device does have better sound playback overall. We use it primary for music.  But the device has several issues that make it worse than our ""old"" Alexa: (1) there seems to be a problem with the microphone. It does not capture the voice commands as good as the old device.  Sometimes we have to raise our voice so loud that the ""old"" alexa responds (and she is at the loft at the second floor!).  Most of the times, the commands do not come as intended.  I can hear from the playback of the commands in the history page that they are not as crisp as the ones recorded in the old device. (2) the smarthome integration embedded in the new alexa fights with our current smarthings hub all the time.  When scanning the sensors we see duplicates for most of them: one from the smarthing hub and another one from the alexa device.  Deleting the ones from alexa builtin smarthome hub fixes the issue.  The new alexa does have a better sound, but we resorted on swaping it for our ""old"" alexa instead and move the new alexa to the second floor, where it is rarely used.

So got a second gen 4 Echo and sub, and when the link up properly then they sound great. It does not always link. Sometimes just plays out of one speaker. The other issue I have with it is the voice commands for audible. You would think that since audible and Alexa are Amazon properties, they would work well together. However, I often, although asking for a certain book to continue, get the last book I listened to starting up. Then when I ask for the sleep timer to be set to 15 mins, something it does it perfect. Other times it sets a timer for 15 mins and audible shutdowns within 30 seconds. Even thought I use the same command each time ""Alexa set sleep timer for 15 mins"".  So I give it 3 stars due to issues to me that cause frustration. But over all the sound is good for a wireless setup.

Sound quality overall is quite good. Its hearing is slightly less responsive than older models - sometimes you have to repeat the wake word more often to get a response. And part of the sphere is covered so you don't appear to have a full 360 speaker. Also the madatory, new, white cord is hideous. Definitely should have left it black or at least given a choice. I can see why some would prefer white - maybe if you're mounting it against a white wall? -- otherwise black is clearly better. I'm actually tempted to paint it black. Finally, can't decide if I like the colored ring on the bottom. I can't see it as well now where I've placed it, so it's slightly inconvenient for me, but this is likely quite particular to the user.

The sound quality is great but then you have to deal with the constant pestering for you to upgrade to the premium package to enjoy more music. It seems every time I start to enjoy the sound quality of the device I'll ask it to play something else and it'll either tell me that song is only on the premium package and would I like to upgrade now to hear that song or I can hear the song but before I do I get asked again if I would like to get the premium package blah blah blah blah. Anyways good sound until you have to hear what alexa or what ever name you choose for your device has to say about blah blah blah.

I don't have a lot of expectations of Alexia. What the Echo Gen 4 does well, it does well. However, when it fails, it does so fantastically. My biggest complaint is that I get it, Echo, Amazon product, Echo is really just a way to drive and direct traffic, particularly consumer traffic to Amazon, but for God's sake it gets a little... unwelcomingly forceful about it sometimes.Build quality of the unit is good.The sound quality is okay. Stereo speakers could be configured a tiny bit better to try to get a little more spread out of them but really nothing can really be done when you cram a left and right channel so close together. Bass, is... bassy. The midrange is okay and the treble is fairly clear without getting too tinny. Voice recognition is okay, when you call her, 95% of the time she hears you.However....This is the real issue. Alexia isn't so good at understanding what you are asking her/of her. Sometimes the results are humorous, but over time that novelty wears off and it just gets irritating.Also... The search engine is BING??? BING??? Really??? Why?!?!?!? Who actually uses BING?!?!?!Hey pssst... Amazon, one word... Google.Integration to lighting systems good. No real complaints there except when Alexia decides to randomly poo the bed because she can't understand what you are asking of her.

The audio quality is leagues better than previous Echo products I’ve used, but that being said there are definitely situations where this product works a lot better than others. I think this speaker needs a smaller to medium sized room for the adaptive audio to really do it’s thing. In a larger space this thing sounds a bit small. This is not a speaker for the back patio or a large living room with tall ceilings. This is a great speaker for the kitchen, the din, or a bedroom. In practice the sound quality & volume is comparable to my Marshall Kilburn II.

Sound quality is very good.  I ""downgraded"" from my Echo Show, gave it to my daughter, because the sound quality in the echo is much better.However, it has a HUGE glitch.  About 50% of the time it does not respond to the wake up word, ""Alexa"" and when it does, another 50% of the time it tells you that the device, lamp, is not connected.  However, when you tell it to turn the lamp on/off gain it will do it.Another issue I'm having is that you ask it something and it will answer something else. i.e ""Alexa what's the weather?"" Answer, ""CNN breaking news...""I thought it might have been my voice, although I've had no problems with previous echo products, so I Asked my daughter to talk to it and the same thing happened.I like the product, just wish Amazon would update the software to fix the issues.

I've had an Echo device since the original was in pre-order, and I got it for $100. Last year, we finally decided it had gotten old enough and traded it in for a new one. That was a mistake.The new Echo's want to be so helpful. Want some music? They'll gladly tell you all about Amazon's Music Unlimited subscription service, that just so happens is NOT included with Prime. Want to listen to the news? It'll turn on TuneIn, which'll make you listen to up to 10 minutes of commercials before actually playing the news. Want to track your Amazon purchases? It'll happily give you notifications, sometimes even without you asking or wanting them, about where your packages are.When the Echo starts blinking yellow, you're supposed to ask it what the notification is. Most of the time, it'll tell you about a Subscribe & Save item that's being delayed, or a package got delivered, etc. But sometimes, it'll recommend a book that you have absolutely no interest in.The book recommendations were my last straw. A little backstory first. As far as I can tell, out of roughly 1500 purchases I've made on Amazon in the last decade, perhaps 5 of them have been books, and none of them for me. They've all been cookbooks, or kids books, as gifts for others. So why, in the name of all that's holy, does the Echo insist on giving me notifications for random books that will be coming out? I don't want them. I don't care what they are. I have never, in the 8 years of owning an Echo, purchased a book through it. I've never asked it to read a book to me. I've never used it to play an audiobook. There is no overlap between what I've told it to do or what I've used it for, and upcoming book releases. That venn diagram is 2 circles with a mile between them. Yet, you CAN NOT disable these notifications. No amount of settings changes, or account updates, or even calling Amazon Tech Support, will remove them.I do not want book notifications. For that reason, I just bought a Homepod Mini, and I'll be returning my Echo. Maybe if Amazon updates their pushy marketing tactics, I'll get another one, but it's not likely.

All in all I consider this new Gen 4 version to be a good reason to upgrade from any of the earlier generations. The fact that it includes a Zigbee hub is a real plus. It is about twice the size of the earlier generations of the Echo which is something to consider if you are limited for space. Build quality is very solid. The only negative I have experienced with the new Echo is for some reason I have had to repeat a few request more than once. I have seldom if ever had to do this with any of the earlier versions. I'm not sure if it is a microphone or possibly a software issue that may be corrected at a later date. I'll just have to wait and see. I'm glad I upgraded, I really enjoy the premium sound.

Setting up a house for a family member for an intercom setup with their phone blue toothed to it. That way they can intercom if need be or call for help if need be.Waiting on the other 3 units coming to finish the setup but they are enjoying even just this one for the ability to ask it questions, control the lights and to listen to the radio.Even if it isn't for me, money well spent for their entertainment and the peace of mind to know they can intercom the rest of the home if they need help or even call me if there is no one there and they can't reach the phone.

This little sphere is pretty dumb.  If I say lunch, she hears launch, setting reminders is interesting, what we say and what she announces is like auto correct gone bad.  All in all, we’re going to put the old one back in the main living area and relegate the sphere to a bedroom or basement.  She’s essentially worthless.

Anything can wake up Alexa. Shows and movies. Strangers outside. Babies babbling. Anything.All that aside, it's very easy to use and it does all kinds of helpful things. The sound quality is surprising for the size. I only wish you could adjust the volume in smaller increments.Every day, I am prepared because I have my weather, news, alarms, and lights on all as I'm rubbing the sleep out of my eyes. Games are available. I think I use it as a sound machine to sleep to more than anything else.I find Alexa's disconnected, sarcastic tone appealing and the design of the device itself stunning.It can do way more than I've found out about and that keeps it interesting. Something new every day.

I love this for music! She “knows” all of my Apple Music as well as Amazon music! If I can’t remember a title but remember a few lyrics, she can find it to play.

I’ve had the original Echo since it first came out, never any problems until recently. I was very apprehensive about getting this one because of all the negative reviews....then I read the same thing in all of them-the light is on the bottom, and the cord is white???!!!! SERIOUSLY??? First of all, I LOVE that the light is on the bottom, I hate that thing, it’s distracting! And the cord? Can’t even see it, when I put it in a place where I could hide it between the couch and side table. But really...who cares about the dang color of the cord? Sound quality is great, we play music on it, and I can hear her loud and clear from down the hall. Very aesthetically  pleasing.  It’s an amazing product, I’m very happy, and I’m a die hard Alexa/Echo user!!👍

I upgraded to Amazon Music Unlimited and received HD music also. The old dots where working find but wanted to create a stereo pair with better sounding speakers. So I purchased the Echo thinking I would have a sonic experience. What has been the result is as follows. The sound is great until the stream stops. This has been a recurring problem since upgrading and purchasing the speakers. I will tell Alexa to play either my playlist or an artist and it starts out fine. Then partway into the first song it will drop out but then starts again. It will play again with no problem for a few songs and then repeat. Not the sonic experience I was looking for. I have tried on at least 3 occasions contacting Amazon and finding a fix. They have been polite but have offered no solution besides restart everything, start from scratch and disconnect the the devices and the internet and reconnect in reverse order. Nothing has worked. I have a robust connection and stream 4K regularly. I am going to reach out to Amazon one more time and if that does not provide relief I will just drop the unlimited music and give Apple a test run.

I’ve got multiple echo dot devices throughout the house, but this one (more expensive) is the only one I have audio issues with.It distorts/audio crackles when streaming firetv.

This item was supposed to come with 6 months of Amazon music free. There was no paperwork or online instructions I found to get the music.  I went in and signed up thru the Echo and got 1 month free.Other then that, it was an easy setup through the App and I'm enjoying the selection available.

I bought this for my fiancé doe Christmas and boy am I glad I did.  I had never had an Alexa before so once we got it set up we started playing music on it and it has the BEST sound ever.

Though this echo has far better sound quality than my old Echo Dot, its user interface is much worse than the Dot was. She constantly just stops interacting in the middle of skills and cannot hear or understand me anywhere near as well. I used to be pretty impressed by how well my Dot could understand me from across the room and assumed that this new Echo would be just as good if not better. Nope.I still enjoy the sound quality although it’s not as good as my Bose countertop speaker is (as I would expect). I get frustrated with this echo constantly just not responding when I talk to it or just stopping in the middle of using certain skills.

Cons: it cannot Cast audio from my phone, does not work with Spotify app, Alexa app is incomprehensible, it shouts ""Now commented to XYZ!"" every time it connects to a device, it keeps flashing colors all day and night with no clear way to stop it, and setting up home theater pairing is bizarrely overcomplicated in the app.Pros: It pairs with the Fire Stick for a home theater setup and works perfectly. Alexa voice recognition is great. Audio quality is great.

I really like the sound and the quality of this speaker.  I was going to buy a bluetooth speaker, but I decided to get amazon echo 4.  I am glad I did it.  I bought 4 of this speaker.

My original 1st Gen Alexa finally died after nearly 8 years. So traded in for this Echo 4th Gen. It is more expensive than the dots and supposedly better sound quality. But don't believe it; mine sucks. Sound is poor and muffled. When it plays music, music can barely be heard. When Echo is speaking, it is LOUD. Also, voice-recognition sucks. ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" Alexa: ""It is 7:04pm now."" And that is when it actually hears me (I have to SHOUT). After four generations, Amazon devices have gotten worse, not better. If you have to buy, stick with the dots.

The Echo was fabulous.  However, we had another one that did not have the hub built in  Sadly,  this hub is zigbee and we need z-wave or z-wave plus.  If we did not have another wonderful Echo,  we would have kept it.  However, we had to return it.  Hopefully, Amazon will include an Echo with Z-wave.

I preface this by stating that I’m not an audiophile, however I do appreciate a good sound system.  Using it in my living room area primarily to listen to music.. It’s a good sized open area…living room, dining room and kitchen . Just the one Echo fills the space with great sound including bass.  I also love the new  modern round shape and size. I purchased the battery charging base too,  so I don’t have to leave it plugged in. Makes it more portable. I signed  up for Amazon Music unlimited as well. The hd ultra quality music sounds amazing playing through the new Echo 4th  generation. Was considering a second one for the same space but not necessary . Very pleased!

Seems that Alexa's hearing problem is how she recognizes her name. If your voice does not sound very close to how you said her name when you trained her to hear you she does not respond. Re training your voice may help just keep in mind that when you do the training try to pronounce her name at different pitches and volumes so she recognizes you more. It helped me out some but not perfectly.  I think the microphones are under her felt covering making it a little harder for her to hear the correct pronunciation of her own name. That's my best guess.Ok I love Alexa devices. I have 6 various devices in my home.  But this newer echo does not impress me. First of all the voice recognition for me is terrible. I don't know where they hid the microphones but it rarely hears me and it sits about 3ft from me. The earlier version does a better job so much so that i put the last edition near me and the new one out in living room. The new one seems to hear better when farther away from you.As for the sound i like the 360 sound much better that the new directional front facing sound in the new echo. The new echo does have better mid range but the 360 just sounds better it the place i put it.
","Negative"

The Good:Unlike some of the other reviewers who’ve upgraded from newer generation echos, I jumped from an original Gen1 Echo to this one and it’s a significant improvement all around and worth upgrading. While not 360 sound, my placement works perfectly for me. The sound quality it leaps above the Gen1. The microphone is more sensitive and accurate as compared to the Gen1. I’m happy with this and glad I got it.The Not So Good:Personally I don’t mind the different color power cord contrasted against the echo...but I see why people might not like it.I’m still trying to figure it out, but I don’t think I can pair my original echo remote with this Gen4. I was using it all the time when building grocery lists. The option doesn’t appear in the Alexa App for this device, but it does for others. :(

So I am new to the whole Alexa thing and initially bought one Echo that was on sale so that I could stream music. Was impressed with it, I bought another  almost right away to put in another nearby room to fill one end of my house with music. I intend to get one more for the bedroom and am considering the sub woofer as well. For any other Alexa newbies like me, it took me 2-3 weeks to figure out that in the app under the audio settings there is a little three band EQ. I was adjusting the volume and bumped the area below where it says audio settings, and lo and behold, the EQ opened up! Even more impressed with the sound quality now and it has me wanting the sub for even more quality sound!

Purchased as an upgrade to older Echo.  Replacing the older device went relatively smooth except two smartthings devices had to be reinstalled.  Otherwise unplug old device, plug in the new device and connect to wifi.  The disappointment was the range of the built in zigbee hub.  Zigbee devices become nonresponsive when about 30 feet from the Echo.  Not very useful.

Great product, good sound for its size, looks great. The built-in b created so many issues we had to reprogram everything in the house. That was three hours of fun we didn't want or need. It's a good unit, but plan accordingly. And it pairs well with other enabled Alexa devices, but know before you expect it to work perfectly. You'll be glad you did, and save yourself the hair you'd be pulling out not knowing this beforehand.

This is my 2nd Echo 4th gen! I ordered it to stereo pair with my 1st one! I was very happy with just using one, but I wanted to see what it would be like to pair them.

We wanted to love this with the premium sound and we have to say, the music quality is improved over the standard model. The issue is listening and responding to or commands.

Other reviewers have also mentioned the hearing/listening problem.

I prefer the original cylinder style Alexa. This new one sounds a little better but it is too big -  it takes up too much space. I got the battery  base because I take Alexa with me - especially when I work outside. The cylinder Alexa is super easy to carry with one hand. I need 2 hands to carry the new Alexa.  To raise or lower the volume on the original, you only have to turn the ring at the top, something you can do in the dark.  The new version has a + and - symbol on the top to raise and lower the volume, very hard to find in the dark!  This is a much poorer design.  It's like the designers went backwards instead of forwards in making the new product. I am trying to decide if I keep it or return it.

This speaker system was acquired at significant expense because it promised compatibility with SiriusXM.  I hired a professional to hook everything up and get the speaker system going, one of the speakers was defective and needed to be returned with great complication and time plus the trouble shooting expense of the hired tech guy to install and troubleshoot.  Next came the disappointment that although these speakers link with SiriusXM, the connection is dropped within a minute or two.  The speaker system will not sustain a connection with SiriusXM.  The music is my main reason for wanting an in home speaker system and this did not live up to its promises, was expensive to purchase and has been expensive to pay a tech guy to troubleshoot defective equipment and Amazon wasted more than an hour of my time with zero customer support and time wasted in the impossible return process.  Was considering Amazon lightbulbs but NO WAY!

This device is better than the competitor’s device but… had to change the wake word because it kept reacting to use of “Alexa” in a commercial, continues to lose connectivity (most likely IP issue), do not know how to make full use of this device and no time to do the research so far. I expect that my rating would increase overtime.

Upgraded from a Echo Dot 3rd gen and I was hoping for better sound. I got way better sound over the Dot. It sounds so much better. I got a free ring light that uses this model as a hub and so far it has worked great together. Works fast when charging light settings.I also hit a few issues that seem like issues with this model. One issue that I have over the my Echo Dot is with Bluetooth. When connected it works great and never disconnects but the fight to get this echo to see my phone is a struggle. Saying ""Connect to my phone"" works rarely. On my Echo Dot its works more around 95% of the time. Once connected though there are no issues with sound or dropping. Second issue is that it seems harder to get it to respond to ""Alexa"". I end up saying it over and over getting louder each time till I feel like I'm yelling at it. Since its 2 feet away on my desk this seems a bit strange. Again the Echo Dot didn't have this issue.Edit: After using it more my Bluetooth issues are worse. I don't now if it's a hardware or software issue but I'm thinking of returning it now.

Somehow I feel like the echo dot is better than this.

I was skeptical about making this purchase ........ “Could it really be as good as the hype?”  NO!!!!!!!!!!! It is actually far better than the hype.  Out of the box it took less than 5 minutes to have Alexa playing. To see how good Alexa is I provided a playlist of several obscure pieces of music. She located them with ease.  The sound quality is excellent and it blends into my home office decor perfect.  To provide a rating of 5-stars is not fair, Alexa should receive 10-stars easily. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Alexa !

The volume and quality of sound with the Echo (4th Gen) with premium sound is definitely worth the money. I have had two Echo dots for a couple of years, and I really enjoy them. But this one beats even having one in each room. I can play just about anything I like and hear it well throughout most of the first floor of my home. I am retired (with great hearing, btw) and it's nice to be able to listen to the ""radio"" (I stream music, NPR, and Audible books through the Echo) while doing chores and tasks. It's great for when I need to make a phone call and I can just tell Alexa to ""stop"" without going to the device to turn it down or off. The sound is good, and the convenience is great.

I just upgraded my five Echo gen 1 to gen 4. Sound quality is much better but amazon music unlimited doesn't work with multi room listening. It will work for 5 to 20 minutes then start glitching out badly. It worked fine with my gen 1 units. Pandora works fine. Tech support can't  figure out what is wrong i have spent quite awhile on the phone with them. I think it has to do with HD audio streaming to multi rooms but im told there is no way to turn off HD audio to the echos. If they fix the issue down the road Ill be very happy with the upgrade and would give 5 stars. Until then I am paying monthly for Music unlimited and tell Alexa to play from pandora whenever I want multi room music.

I have a second generation Echo and I was pretty happy with the sound it has but I wanted to upgrade so I could rig up a cheap surround sound system. This thing has more thump than I ever imagined that it would. I live in a top apartment, so I try to respect my neighbors but at 35-40%, I can feel the bass in the floor. I'm scared to turn it up to 100% because I'd probably have my neighbors and the cops knocking at my door. I would turn the midrange up to get more volume on the voice but the bass is really intense as is, no adjustments. I actually bought 2 of them but haven't hooked up the second one yet because it's pretty good as is coming from 1.

It’s a spear shape and I really prefer the old design over this one. Second, the microphone can be very poor sometimes. Oftentimes my echo dot in the room next door can hear me way easier than the 4th Generation Echo. Not a huge issue but definitely something to consider. Overall, this is a great product. The sound is premium and for the price, your getting a lot.

This is an upgrade for me from the fist black, cylindrical echo device which I still love. This new echo device looks really cool, and to me it seems a better fit in most rooms of my home. The sound quality is fantastic with deep bass and loud volume. The controls are easy to use and very accessible. The Alexa support is great which I expected.The only downside i have discovered is the voice recognition. We have to shout for this device to clearly recognize our words. Our old echo device is actually perform much better with voice and word recognition.Overall, I would recommend purchasing this device. If you have the old echo and you want a replacement, this is a suitable device with better sound quality.

I love Alexa’s and most echos. The house is filled with them. However this model has the worse possible sound for music. Massive bass that even using the EQ destroys any music. Mediocre mids and trebles. The previous generation was way better. What happened?

In my opinion, the current Echo (4th generation) is a much nicer looking speaker than previous Echo models.  Sound quality is on par with the previous generation, with enhanced bass.  Setup is easy.  If you liked the previous generations of this product, you will like this model.

Great for music on the patio or the back yard.  It has enough bass for jazz or rock.  Nice option especially if you buy it on sale.

The sound is good, and when it works it’s good. But this thing is so temperamental. When playing music via either Amazon prime, or Apple Music (the source does not matter), it will just stop. Sometimes several minutes in, sometime 40 seconds into the first song. It’s not an internet issue as other devices are fine, and there is no internet drop. I’ve also had it just start playing one song on loop. I also have it connected to fire TV so I can watch tv with sound coming out of the echo. It works, but again there are so many bugs. Often the remote becomes i operative and echo becomes unresponsive. Sometimes randomly their is just no sound and instead fire tv plays sound out of the tv speakers instead. And then randomly, echo will turn the tv on, when nothing is playing or requested. It’s so buggy that I’m about to throw it away. I have some other Alexa devices, Including a really early version before the echo dots (without built in speaker). One is in my garage and I have it plugged into an old stereo for sound. It works perfectly, streaming same music sources. So it’s not an internet connection issue. This echo is just not good software. These issues are all over google, and the answer is simply to have to unplug it and wait to reconnect to reset it. Doing this several times a day is not acceptable.

I like my new Echo. I enjoy playing question of the day, and song quiz. I also like the shopping list feature as well as notifications and timers. The only negative I have is voice recognition, especially when playing games. It doesn't always recognize the answers as being correct, but that is a small thing as far as I'm concerned. This is one of my favorite Christmas gifts.

The fun is learning what the Echo is capable of doing. Being new to me, I have just begun to discover some of the simple commands Alexa will respond to. As time goes by, I’m certain I’ll be asking Alexa to do more and more. I do have one suggestion and that would be to make the bass and treble levels adjustable. I think music would sound much better with this modification. Other than this, it’s a great product.

What a waste of money. I upgraded from a 2nd gen dot when Amazon offered me a good price on this one.  I waited weeks for delivery only to be charged the full price and received a device that seems to be deaf and lazy.  At least once or twice a day Alexa ignores my voice (it sits maybe 3 ft from my office desk) and randomly quits playing in the middle of a song.  No break in wifi, no interruption other than she just doesn't feel like doing it anymore.Total ripoff.

I love the ability to Mute this model. I also have a 1st Generation Tap, which could not be muted and was hard to turn off due to the Battery on a TAP. I have been successful at linking up to a Phillips Hue Smart Bulb as well as the Free A19 Ring Bulb that was included with this special offer. The Ring bulb was a Challenge. The Hue was so easy to link up to the built in Zigbee smart hub. Now I can also control the lights through my old Amazon Tap as well!Edit: found you can mute the 1st Gen tap.

Bought this to replace my original first generation echo. Sound quality is really good and I don't have to shout to have it recognized commands when It is playing music. I have two other echo dots and an echo show 5. It is the best sounding out of the group. Only paid $49 for it. Very happy with the purchase. Set up was a piece of cake since I already had existing echos. The wife likes to look of it more than the original echo. As others have stated having a white cord with a black echo just doesn't make sense. But it's probably cheaper for Amazon to have the only buy one style of AC adapter so they don't have to color match them.

Our original Echo was a first edition it’s been almost five years and it started to have some issues so we bought the newest version as a primary replacement.  So far we have noticed that the microphone isn’t quite as sensitive in picking up on the trigger word, and occasionally misunderstands what we have asked.  The speakers sound nice, although a level 4 volume on the new one is about the same as level 5 volume on the original.  The new one has a temperature monitor but will only read it out to us as centigrade (we have it set for Fahrenheit.)  Overall, we enjoy having it as we use the device for smart home and also for things like the grocery list.

I love everything that Alexa is capable of doing.The only thing I'm not thrilled about is the bass tone.  It's very loud and since I live in an apartment building,  I'm concerned that the bass tone is so loud when I play music that I fear it may be disturbing my neighbors .  As a result, I have to keep my music low in volume.🙁

I traded in my two echo dot 3rd gens for the new version.Pros:- EXTREMELY high quality speakers which actually provide decent bass.-processing speed is much improved over previous gen. Especially when using apps such as “myChevrolet” to start your vehicle. There is far less “hang up” in between commands.-set up is very easyCons:-Compared to the echo dot 3, this thing takes up WAY more space. I should have payed closer attention to the dimensions. Ultimately I really wanted the new version with the led clock, but there were back ordered at the time.-Besides faster processing, and slightly better speakers, it’s almost exactly the same.The price is way too high for only a slight upgrade.

The round echo 4th Gen is an improvement over the previous echo i had. I thought the previous one (a silver cylinder) was a pretty good speaker and thought good as a smart hub, but the 4th Gen is better. It's a really credible speaker and fills a small room pretty well. It can hear me through a concrete wall on the other side of the apartment. That is so good it is almost creepy. It does well integrating Sonos and hue lights. I understand it's going to have other skills in the future. I like the way it looks. I like the news function. I could recommend it to anyone who needs a smart home hub and doesn't mind having a thing to spy on you. Alexa is far better than Siri as far as getting things right much of the time.

21SEP2021: I wanted a smart device to control my home and answer my questions. Alexa on Echo uses Amazon's proprietary search engine. Google is the gold standard for search engines, in my humble opinion. Amazon's engine meets the level of aluminum; the most abundant metal on earth. The Echo device is very capable as far as the hardware is concerned. However, the software, and the search engine in particular, is junk. After 6 months, I quit. I must admit that I now own a very expensive voice activated switch system that understands me 50% of the time.19FEB2022: I am happier with Ziggy. His voice is more pleasing to my ears. I call him ""Computer"". I miss him when I'm away from home but have yet to find an affordable option so he can travel along with me. My smartphone won't keep Alexa running without quickly sucking the battery dry; even connected to power in the car. However, I am finding that the Alexa software is getting smarter and there are more skills and blueprints available now. I am hopeful that this trend will continue. Thank you devs!!

Upgraded my echo 2nd gen's to the newer version and the sound quality is definitely a lot better but...Alexa on this version is horrible at recognizing the activation command.  I'm not sure if it's the mesh exterior covering the mics more than the previous one, but it's typical to yell her name several times before she responds.  The spatial/location activation is terrible on these as well, so good luck trying to control one that is closer to you with voice commands.  I can be standing right in front of the one I'm trying to give a volume command to and it'll change the one in a completely different room.  Not exactly sold that this was worth the better sound having to fight with her everyday. 😔

Searar is an odd shape for electronic device. It does not look modern. Audio quality is superb for the size. It’s a great idea to include the Zigby hub. However even Amazon is confused on what devices are supported to directly work with this device. I could not find sensors that reliably work with this echo fourth generation. Awara sensors don’t work, Amazons on ring sensors don’t work. It is a great product with an odd shape but Amazon still does not have the complete story on this yet. Best sensors use Seaver, but Amazon abandoned zwave in this echo. Sphere is an odd shape that does not match the modern angular/square decor. Sadly, I retuned mine.

I fought the urge to get one for years and I was wrong.

I needed a new Echo for my home office and I debated whether to get the standard ""dot"" of splurge on this premium model.  Luckily, this one went on sale which made the decision easy.  I'm so glad I went with this premium version.  The sound is amazing!  The bass is killer, the range is full, and it creates the illusion of surround sound (at least where I'm using it).  All the features of Alexa are there, along with a few added extras to help it act as a home automation hub (something I'm just starting to explore).  But the best thing about this product though is the sound.  Bravo Amazon on this one!

This was a little larger than our clock version, however with the speakers that makes sense.

I gave this a 5* based on performance, music sounds very good and volume can get very loud if you want to turn it up.  Only complaint for me is that it's quite large and bulky, not as attractive as past echo's.  I put this in our living room and it just looks out of place, not like the older one that I moved to the bedroom.  Anyway, if you want good sound and good music, this would be perfect for you.

We have echo's all over the house.  Used them for years.  Our primary echo is in the kitchen which can be heard in the dining and living rooms.  Reading that the sound quality was so good, we decided to try this.  Well first, we didn't really like the looks.  Hard plastic rounded up the back and just not that good looking.  I know that is a personal choice.Now, if you are buying this for great louder sound, for anyone that has used echo's before, you know a echo remote is great for speaking to it and controlling the volume.The echo remote does not function on this and 4th gen devices which means we have to yell at the echo to try and do anything.  This is not only annoying and most of the time doesn't hear us but the loud requests are heard all over the house which lights up all the other echo devices.If you are close and want to control it manually, it sounds great but a little expensive.We sent it back and going for a 3rd gen echo but currently having problems with the echo remote on these devices.  If we want to use the remote we may have to  go back to our 2nd gen echo.

This product makes life so much easier. I was hesitant at first because my sister has a previous version and it often malfunctioned. Fortunately, the 4th gen has high quality voice recognition. It’s incredibly accurate, and I receive answers and info quickly from Alexa. I’ve already seen in two different places where I’ve been prompted to use tech support if needed. I haven’t had an issues for them so far, but I love that the Echo 4th gen has the reliable and easily accessible option. The sound quality is insane!  My family played a few different genres of music at full volume and the 3 sub woofers make such a difference. We heard every sound clearly and accurately even when we were all outside. I love all of the options Alexa has as well like adding reminders or asking about the weather. So efficient!!!

I have 11 of these in my house and they used to be great.  Extra beeps started to happen some months ago and now when you wake the device it beeps at you in mid-sentence (I have that setting off on all).  Also, my kitchen Echo always attempts to play all music to Sonos, which I have disconnected (including the skill) more than 1 year ago. When it can't it errors and doesn't play any music at all. I have replaced the device with a new one and the new one does the same. The other devices do not do this Sonos attempt. Also, when I give a command 75% of the time the devices continue to talk about other subjects (""By the way....""). This is really awful.  There are other issues, but these are really annoying and fairly new (last year or so)

The echo seems to have a hard time recognizing me when there is any noise, particularly the TV is on. I tried several locations, and it works best right beside me :-).One other issue, it doesn't seem to remember room configurations. I can reset and it almost recognizes all my devices. I have a generation 3 echo dot that works so much better.

I do really like the new design/look of the Echo 4th gen device.  However, I expected the sound quality to step up a notch, and I think it could actually have dropped a notch instead, but very little.  I also think the voice recognition doesn't seem to be as good as other models.  Not sure if they did something different with the microphone array or not, but I quite often find myself asking a question and having an Echo from the other room respond, so it seems the microphones are not as sensitive.  It's important to note that I am not dissatisfied by audio quality since I have them pairs with the Echo sub, but without the sub I think the previous model sounds better overall.

I put the new Echo in my workshop. It was a lot larger than I expected. It's about the size of a cantaloupe.

The little Bose sounds a bit better, but having Alexa and music on demand makes up for it.Sound:To me (Gen X with a need for bass), the new Echo sounded great but lacked bass.HOWEVER, I bought the Echo Subwoofer and the combination of those is great.

We signed on early to the original Echo smart home hub, and it served us well for years, but it struggled at times with all the noise in our home. We have a lot of pets, mostly birds, and they all have something to say, and our original Echo sometimes just gave up when we tried to use it. With the new generation of Echo, voice recognition is greatly improved, sound quality is excellent, and the device is more attractive in general.

The sound is great. This speaker is highly recommended if you're looking for a good quality small speaker with lots of bass, for home or office use. The sound is even better if you adjust the equalizer to your liking.However actually controlling the device can be tricky, as the microphones aren't the best quality. I have an Echo Flex which has better microphones than this, however that might be because the Flex is hooked up to external speakers. But then again, it might not be. All I'm saying is Amazon probably could have done a better job with the microphones on these Echo devices.To summarize, the speaker has great sound and works well, Albeit with mediocre microphones.

I can’t rave enough about this echo 4 and all it’s features, from the great quality sound that plays all my favorite songs, how easy it is to manage your other devices such as my amazon fire stick to my tv through the use of Alexa’s integration. The voice recognition works amazingly when it comes to asking Alexa questions such as weather, news, sports, playing specific songs, audio books, setting up morning and night time routines, adding to my shopping list, dropping in on my family, leaving my son a message when he gets home if I’m not there, setting up your own question like who does the dishes etc. and many more. This device definitely will not disappoint! I’d  absolutely recommend that everybody get one or two or three lol it’s just that awesome!

We really like the sound. Best one yet in terms of sound quality. Unfortunately it is really bad at picking up our voice compared to the other Echo devices. You either have to yell really loud or get very close. Not so bad when its not playing anything or the room is really quite. But still worse than the other earlier devices. This get much worse of course the louder you have it playing music and that is where it's really different than previous generations. So there is a price to pay for having great sound, which is poor voice recognition. And yes it was setup to recognize our voices.

No matter what I did, it would only set up connecting to my Sonos Arc. So I had to put my echo 2nd gen back in my bedroom and return the echo 4th gen. It was nice looking I can't comment on sound because it would only play stuff through my Sonos Arc which sounds very good. But I wasn't willing to spend $99 for something that would only alert me of packages being delivered. All of the other sounds timers and alarms would go through the Sonos Arc which it does by itself. I am disabled I can't fight with these devices to make them work correctly.

I am so glad that I purchased this echo. The speakers sound so much better than my pucks. The first time I used it, the bass was so strong, it sent one of my canisters flying to the floor. No harm. It is much larger and heavier than the pucks too. I'm going to buy a stand soon, but I haven't made up my mind on which one yet. I don't know if it can hear better because of the larger size, I'm just in the testing stage on that.

The only way to temporarily fix the problem was to unplug it and plug it back in, but it would go offline again within a day or so. A factory reset didn't resolve it. I suspect that some of the reviews complaining the device could not hear their voice well might be experiencing the same issue with it going offline. I'll update this review after I spend some time with the replacement I received.

First off, the speaker sounds terrific! How they can get such deep bass out of something so small is beyond comprehension. I'm not fond of the new spherical form factor, but if that's what is enabling the great sound then it's well worth it.Unfortunately, Alexa doesn't hear me say the wake word at least half the time so I end up screaming at the speaker. I've been told I have a voice that carries, and I never had a problem with the previous generation Echo not hearing the wake word, even while playing relatively loud music. I have an Echo Show I had the same problem with when I first got it and it's gotten better over time, so hopefully updates will take care of this eventually.

I had issues connecting this device during set-up to a rural 4G LTE modem / router set-up.  No matter what settings I tried it would not work.  To fix, I had to turn on an Android or iPhone mobile hotspot temporarily with the same network name and password as my primary router, unplug my primary router temporarily, connect the device using the hotspot (which worked fine), then turn off the mobile hot spot and turn the router back on.  The Echo worked fine after that on the existing network, even though it refused to connect to it up front.  Not sure why this works, but suspect it has something to do with initial DNS or IP handling through a 4G LTE static modem set-up.

This is to let the 8 yr old play annoying songs like Who Let the Dogs Out without bugging us to look them up.  But, I gotta say, it sounds great, and the family all enjoy it.

I have this in my living room and bought it to play my classical music while sitting in there. The sound for my operas and orchestral music is rich and beautiful. The set up was easy. I have had no problem at all playing the music already purchased and downloaded from my iPad and iPhone to the Echo 4. You just have to play with the controls a little bit to figure out how to do it and it is easy.  I have multiple other Echos in my home and this does not interfere with them. I have had no problems with voice recognition as others say they have had. This is perfect for what I wanted it for. Great choice and much better sound in my opinion than previous Echos which I would not play my classical music on.

Sometimes Alexa has a hard time understanding me, but maybe it's just my accent. Overall I am very pleased.

You're gonna want to purchase Amazon music. I would definitely purchase something like this again.

Alexa Algorithm was getting worse with my 2nd/3rd gen device. But with this 4 she is horrible she can’t hear or doesn’t know s$@?!. She plays the wrong thing when she does hear me. Amazon needs to update YouTube and Apple Music Skills on the Alexa App. stereo pairing should be bluetooth capable (unless I’m missing something).Sound quality best when 2 speakers paired.

This 4th gen iteration of the Echo Dot is phenomenal. No screaming necessary, very seamless Alexa AI experience. Top that with the added subwoofer built within the higher-end model of the 4th gen Echo Dot.I have no con’s for this product at all. Though I do have a no brainer that someone could but shouldn't put on their con list. The Echo Dot may not respond well, when paired with too much surrounding noise I.e. The echo being too close to a loud TV, or a noisy party.

I really love this speaker. I listen to music using my Amazon music subscription. The sound is really fabulous and better than the Dots. Some third party reviews say the bass is only so so, but I think it's great-I love a good beat! In fact, I have to be careful because I live in an apartment building. Maybe people need to make sure they set it in the right place, not sure. Works great for me. Alexa always understands me, even with background noise. Highly recommend this product for the price!

So far everything works fine with it except it will not connect to att's fixed wireless internet! Amazon sent me a new one and the new one does the same thing. Will not connect to the wifi, It will find the wifi and take the password but it will not connect to it. Att finally said it is not compatible because it needs IP pass through and fixed wireless cannot do that so they are currently working on the situation to get it compatible. There is no telling how long that could take! I see on Att's forums people have been having this issue for over a month now. I gave it 5 stars because everything is working great as it should, It is really loud too. I have the Amazon echo 4th gen in twilight blue.

Very satisfied with my new Echo (4th ggeneration). The microphones are very sensitive and pick up my commands evens with a lot off background noise. I do like the new design.

I was hoping this could be a cheaper solution for respectable surround sound for my house but the truth is that these are absolutely not the quality anyone would expect who is really looking to replace a sound system for easy plug n play wifi connected speakers. Yes they work, yes it is easy, NO these are not premium sound. Maybe they are premium in contrast to other echo devices but not comparable to other sound systems.You absolutely get what you pay for in this case…Cheap stuff yields cheap results.

While I generally like the looks and sound quality of this new version, the voice recognition seems very noticeably inferior to any of the previous versions I've used.This replaced a Gen1 device, and while the original reliably picked my voice out of the background noise, this unit struggles, either not triggering at all or mishearing what I'm saying.  This is made worse by the fact that the blue 'listening' light is now at the bottom where it's difficult to see, so I don't even know it hasn't heard me until nothing happens.  With the earlier units with the indicator on top that was less of an issue.For these reasons, I'm considering returning this and going back to a 'vintage' unit.

I'm overall very happy with this Echo.  (I prefer the Echo Shows overall)  We use it in our kitchen / living room on a side table for listening to radio / music and running our Ring/Alexa integration.  Sound is good for under $100 and the muted blue ball color adds interest to an otherwise grey / brown / white room.  Only gripe:  an off-white cord?  You sell it in black, white, and dusty blue and you can't SKU a colored wall wart?  C'mon, Jeff.  Do better.

I just unboxed my 4th gen Echo an hour ago. I ordered the Charcoal color because it will sit on top of my home theater’s BLACK subwoofer. The first thing I noticed was that the charger and cord are white! That’s going to look just great snaking across the top of the subwoofer!!!I have places in my home where I want white devices with white cords but sometimes I need a black device with a black cord. What ever happened to “The customer is always right?” Would giving us a choice be such a hardship?My white 2020 Echo Show 5 came with a white cord. Perfect. My black 2018 Echo Spot came with a black cord. Perfect. My black 2016 1st Gen Echo came with a black cord. Perfect. How was I to know that all of a sudden Amazon was going to turn into Apple and make nothing but white adapters and cords?And on top of everything, I can’t even swap cords with one of my other devices because the little proprietary plugs are different sizes!You can see I’m pretty deep into Echo land but my brother just got a Google device which he says is great. And then there’s the fact of my iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air and Apple Watch. Maybe there are HomePods in my future?

This is our 4th Echo I believe, we just love them, they are so useful on a daily basis.So when this upgraded one came out with the limited colors I decided to get one for the family room so we can all enjoy the new speaker system when we listen to music.There is a definite difference between this 4th gen and the older models. The speaker is updated- it's louder and the sound quality is better.I only gave it 4 stars because so far Alexa doesn't respond as fast as the other versions and sometimes we have to repeat our request multiple times.

I have 2 of the original devices and upgraded both to the bigger Echos. The sound is so much better and so is the bass. It came with 4 months of Sirius XM for free and it’s so awesome on the Echo.

They design a device to look aesthetically pleasing to the eye as it sits on your counter or table. And then they send your Charcoal or Twilight Blue device with a white power cord. Pretty unbelievable that they did not color match the cord, especially since it needs to remain plugged in 100% of the time. Really disappointed. Returning three of these tomorrow. Google Home, here I come.FOLLOW UP - So I got a quick call and email from Amazon. But their response was even more disappointing. Here's the email:Hello, My name is Christian and I’m from Amazon’s Technical Support team. I'm sorry to hear about the issue/s experienced with your 4th Gen Echo, which prompted you to leave a critical review on Amazon.com. I tried to reach you over the phone, but unfortunately we didn't connect.  I understand you're rather concerned about the aesthetics of the white power cord. This was an intentional decision that we made so that the power cord could more easily blend in with white background (think drywall, etc.). Since we'd still like to offer you some options, you're free to purchase a replacement power adapter in black at the link below (your model takes 30 watts): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S8K1RPWhat a load of crap - This ""think drywall"" rationale makes sense if you have drywall that is painted white, which I can tell you, no one in the northeastern United States has. Amazon made the decision to throw a white cord in every box to save money on the non-white devices and/or get people to shell out another $20 for the color cord that should have been in the box. Really disappointing from Amazon and really shortsighted.2ND UPDATE - So, Amazon dropped the price on these by $30.00. I bought three of them, so I decide to stick with the Alexas despite the cord issue on the black. I call to get a price adjustment. Nope, you have to return all three and buy three new ones. Clearly Amazon is hoping this will be an impediment to customers trying to get the lower price. I say, that makes no sense because Amazon is going to have to eat additional shipping plus reboxing. Sales rep tells me, they have to do it that way because there are only so many at the sales price. Another customer service line of crap. So, in theory, they are going to take my $100 Alexas, put them on the side and sell them only after the sale. Doubtful.Overall, good product for the money. But terrible job by Amazon.

I switched to Echo so I could plug mine directly into my sound system (Google Assistant devices don't have this feature.) The only complaint I have is that I ask Alexa to play a song, and she plays a song that is not the one I asked for. I am pretty sure this is Apple Music's fault, but it needs to be addressed.

When I got this latest version, I put it in the same spot as it's predecessor, which was surrounded by junk.I noticed the increased bass immediately but thought the higher frequencies were muffled.  This was quickly remedied by moving it to a higher and unobstructed location and am now enjoying the much improved, fuller range of this very compact unit.

I'm not a very techy person but have 2 other Echo's.  I purchased this one to use in my office which is also my workout room.

I also purchased an item to anchor it on my wall which I like.

We’re in the processing of making our home smart and setting up our Alexa enabled devices. The Echo has excellent sound quality. Everyone in our family has no issues with using it.

Overall, it’s really cool and I love it!

Alexa, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?  HOW is it even possible that I have not bought, owned,  used or watched a friend use this device?

Not a bad unit. I purchased this as a ""clock radio"" to wake me up in the mornings with internet radio stations since my Grace internet radio will not be functional after 1/31/21 once the Reciva station database/aggregator goes permanently offline. The Echo has a good sound quality, but I mostly bluetooth the audio from the device to the soundbar in our bedroom. The only cons I've found thus far are 1. The white cord. Why?? and 2. Sometimes the device doesn't hear the commands I give when music is playing at a large volume. I have to make my voice louder when the music is playing in order for the device to hear me. Other than those two issues, it was a good purchase.

This is one of our best purchases ever!  We have one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom.  We love it and use it all the time.  I'm glad we upgraded to the Alexa with the better sound -- the sound is great.  We can adjust it so that we can hear it in the family room, or if we want soft music at bedtime we can adjust it for that.  We also have a subscription to Pandora.  So, we can ask it to play one of our Pandora stations.  It is absolutely wonderful!!!

This thing has phenomenal sound. Nothing says “wake up, why don’t you put on a little make up” like Amazon music blasting nu metal at 4am. Then realizing I’m just a “small town girl, who took the train going to anyyyyy. Work” It also cuts my lights on and off which is nice because one I lay down I am done. It’s the 2021 clapper with an alarm and a noise machine to help me sleep. Works so well I woke up thinking it was a storm outside because Amazon’s “thunder storm” relaxing sound has a lightening strike about two hours in. 10/10, I have three of them.

Having used some of the Echo Dots, I decided to try the Echo 4th Generation.  Immediately, I was impressed with the sound quality compared to the Dots, so much so that I have since bought 2 more.  Couple downfalls, first, the ring that lights up being at the bottom does take some getting used to, but not a big deal.  Second, I do find, as many others have, that it does not hear my voice good a lot of times and I find myself speaking loudly or getting close to the device for it to hear my voice commands.  But other than that, a pretty straight forward Echo device and I think it will serve my needs well.

I'm elated with this product. The sound quality is a remarkable improvement over the third generation ""dots."" However, after the first week of continuous use (I keep Alexa busy!), here are some things I noticed, all of which don't spoil my experience with this device.--The microphone to alert Alexa is near the base. So trying to make a request from above the device will not get a reply. This dot is placed by my bedside, but I've elevated it on two books, to make the microphone easily usable.--For those of us who are unable to use a hand-held device, we can't change the settings with any available app for computers--there apparently aren''t any--so we'll use this dot in ""default"" settings. So when I try to bring some music to a dot in one room (I have three third-generation dots besides this ""advanced"" dot), I get an offer by Alexa to switch the music from one device in another room, to the device I'm making the request from, but it never works--either Alexa turns the music off in the other room, or she's unable to turn it off, but nonetheless, I get no music from the dot I'm closest to! So I'm downgrading this to three dots--If the engineers can make an app for computers, I'll raise the rating accordingly.

So far I am having none of the problems stated in the reviews, so far! Was not expecting wonderful or great for the money but for general listening it's fine. Better than the Echo 4 specifically in the base area and her voice. Tested them side by side, maybe 3 inches between and both responded the same.My grandson set this up while I was at Sam's so can't say it's hard to set up, he's 9! For what it is and what it cost I'm happyShape, who care's,  I don't sit and look at it. No worse than a square box.Don't care for the flashing, should only flash when someone talks to it so user knows it was heard.

The sound is very impressive compared to my original Echo cylinder. This has deep bass and sounds like a big speaker in my family room. However, it seems like Alexa is now more deaf and sometimes I say a command and she lights up and ignores me. Just today, she was playing a song, and I said, ""Alexa I don't like this song."" but she kept playing. She only followed after the fifth time I told her.The trade-in promotion is also tricky. Maybe it's my timing. It takes a while for Amazon to get the trade-in due to Ground shipment. By the time they get the items and credited me for it and give me the 25% off, sale was over.

If you use a Goldilocks metaphor for these speakers, this is the perfect Mama Bear....and Mama knows best. She may not have the full weight of Papa Bear, or the smaller footprint of Baby Bear, but she knows how to rule the roost. The sound is truly amazing despite her modest size with remarkable bass presence for such a small sphere. The sound is well balanced and will fill a room much larger than you might imagine. Besides the new Echo, I have the Echo Studio and several Echo Dots situated around our home. It is a nice mixture and provides just the right amount of sonic reinforcement we need for our  music and informational requirements. Each of the three sizes do what they do very well. I would highly recommend any of them based on your personal needs and desires.

It does everything a regular echo dot does and so much more (like tell you the inside temperature). I highly recommend it.

I love the sound quality of my Echo. It is a relatively small device for such great sound. I own an old school stereo system with speakers that contain twin active 12 inch woofers, a 5 inch midrange and a super dome tweeter in each speaker cabinet, so I know good sound.  This Echo has clear lows and bright highs. When I want to listen to my favorite music, talk radio or my favorites list, I simply request it! This device has many more untapped features. My son recently purchased  an Echo. He has his turning on lights, his radio and providing audio security for his apartment and more. This product is like having a personal assistant. Thanks Amazon!

I have the original Echo, but the sound quality was a little lacking. The new Echo has much better sound, but Alexa's voice is significantly louder than the music it plays. Not sure why or how to correct.Also, the new one doesn't recognize me as often as the original did. I estimate the original was a hit 8 or 9 out of 10; the new one only hits 6 or 7 out of 10 times. It also seems to be confused by my instructions more often than before.  But, the sound / music quality is far better. Hoping the recognition will improve.

I have a Gen 1 Echo which is still working well. However, I would not pair it with my Fire TV because it can't push out enough sound volume. The new generation of Echo comes with a much better array of speakers. The bass is solid. Its sphere design allows it to project sounds to fill a room more effectively. I have a small TV in my kitchen. I paired it with the new Echo and a Fire TV stick. Echo makes it sounds like a much bigger entertainment system.One thing I do hope Amazon can address is to design an Echo in a soundbar format such that I can put it in front of my TV without blocking the view. Right now, I have to hide the Echo sphere behind the TV. It weakens the sound.

First of all why is it that my friends can ask the google assistant on their phone the same exact question that I ask Alexa and they get an in depth thorough response and i get nothing. Or i have to go find and download some skill in order to make her more knowledgeable on something when google is capable of finding the answer and reading it. I have the same problem with Siri on my iPhone, Siri and Alexa are both idiots in my opinion and rarely do they actually do what I ask or answer a random question i have like google does. I wish i had realized this sooner and ordered a google home device speaker or something other that Alexa. I love the ability to play pretty much whatever music i ask but that comes with a music subscription and that's the speakers job so again nothing really to brag about.

I wanted a replacement for my original Echo. I liked the fact that the new Echo could also serve as a hub for other devices. It was a snap to set up and name. After plugging in a smart plug it was recognized immediately by the Echo and I used the plug to control them lights on my Christmas tree. The sound is also quite respectable and the price drop makes it a good choice.

I have a echo dot 3 and a echo view which I couldn't of been happier with. But when I got this new one it blew me away.

I’m not an audiophile, but, I love music. I have Echos paired in stereo in 3 separate rooms. 1 room has the paired subwoofer. 2 of my Echos have battery packs so that I can take them outside and have stereo sound on my patio. The sound quality is great for my needs. I use Spotify as my music source which works well. I have multiple different groupings where I can isolate music, or play it everywhere at once. I love being able to walk around my house and have the same music playing in every room and on the patio when I walk outside. I gradually built up to 8. They are from three different generations including four 4th generation.

After a couple of months the sound quality went south, it became muffled when playing music and distorted when the Echo Plus responded to voice.  Called Amazon and they were outstanding in resolving this issue. They immediately issued an order for a replacement which will arrive within two days.

So after trying them all, I've decided to return both the new 4th Gen Alexa Dot, the bigger Alexa Echo (in red), and all the smart bulbs in white (boring). My 3rd Gen dots are fantastic, and they're plugged into Edifier speakers, so there's literally nothing new or better for me in the 4th Gen. (Except red spheres are mod and cool.)Plus the new ones, especially the dot, are hard of hearing. And the dot is twice as large (vertically) as it was before, so I'll keep the 3rd Gen one I keep in my suitcase for dog sitting stayovers too. And the 4th Gen don't seem to have good audio jacks, because my Edifiers only play out one speaker, but work fine with the same cable on my 3rd Gen Dot.I did however upgrade my mood lights in my room with RGB smart bulbs, so now I can go purple or whatever color I want. In theory, I could program them to change hue according to the temperature outside, or the price of corn.I also saw that there's a battery base for the 3rd Gen dot, so I'll try that out. Turns it into a portable smart Bluetooth speaker! Perfect for staying at somebody else's house.I'm only bummed because the red orb is so pretty.

Great voice recognition. It heard me when I whispered, even when playing music. Much better the the other 4th gen Alexa. But it is big! About as big as Saruman’s Palantír. I wasn’t sure if I should play music or take over middle earth.Ultimately returned the unit because it was too big.

I have been an Alexa Echo and Echo Dot user since its inception. Unfortunately, as much as I want to love the devices and entire eco system, I'm often frustrated. My main use for this Echo is having it bedside and to listen to audible.com audio books. Yet, while in its 4th generation, it still doesn't understand half of what I say. The audiobooks often sound distorted and the narration usually muddy. I've tried adjusting the treble, mid, and base to no avail. It is like its either just a midge to loud or not loud enough. I wish there was a way to adjust the volume controls by half levels. Perhaps, we may see improvements with updates.

I bought this to replace an Echo 1.  I wanted to test the sound quality, try out the Sidewalk network feature, experiment with the Zigbee hub, and gain support from Amazon.  The Echo 1 was near its end-of-life support.  I am happy to report that all of my expectations were met.

I've had every version of echo since they've been out and this one is this worst.  Alexa seems to be back tracking on understanding.  So much of what she could understand on the 1st generation she is clueless on on this generation.  I don't know how many times I ask her something fairly simple and she says she can't answer that or she'll totally misunderstand and answer something else.  I'll ask,  she'll misunderstand,  I'll ask again,  she'll still misunderstand,  my husband will ask, she may understand,  she may not, I'll try a different way and she'll tell me she doesn't know that.  Very frustrating to have her going backwards in technology.  Sound, though, is great when playing music.

Great sound, never heard the Gen 1 sound as good.Needs help hearing commands. Gen 1 can hear me in the next room, this one has to finish getting the wrong command until it is done. Never asked for music but it played and it wouldn't hear me until the song was over.

I traded in my first generation Echo and Echo Plus for a fourth generation Echo in black and another one in white.  Like: The new model sounds better than both of my previous Echoes.  I sat them side by side and played a song with plenty of bass at the same volume level.  The new model was louder and produced deeper bass.  I prefer the sphere over the cylinder and the fabric cover over none at all.  The internal temperature sensor is a nice addition as is the Zigbee hub.Dislike: This latest version has A LOT of trouble hearing me even when I'm in the same room it's in and the room is quiet.  In fact, sometimes my third generation Echo Dot hears me despite it being in the adjacent room.  I frequently have to repeat myself or raise my voice before the new model hears me.  This was never the case with the devices I traded in.  I read somewhere the latest Echo has just 4 microphones instead of 7.  What a shame.  I really hope Amazon corrects this issue for the fifth generation Echo.  Finally, I hate that the black unit came with a white power cord.  They should match.

This is the third Echo we have owned. The other two are second generation ones. Those two are awesome and have just been moved to other areas of the house. This echo is by far the worst. Imagine having a bot that is like an unruly child. Never listening. Always having to have instructions repeated three or four times. You can stand two feet from this device and clearly annunciate your request and nothing. It will light up to its name but then it fails to do anything. Meanwhile devices in entirely different areas of the house spring into action. On the off chance this one actually responds be prepared for a wait of 30-60 seconds before it does anything. I am almost at a point of kicking this aptly shaped ball of electronic failures to the curb. Rubbish. Absolute rubbish.

I echo (ha) the sentiments of other reviews. For whatever reason, the microphone really struggled with me. Commands like ""Alexa, lights at 20% brightness"" or even ""Alexa, lights on"" often failed to register. And when they did, there were often multi second delays. I recently switched to the echo studio for the sound quality, and was surprised with its responsiveness in contrast to the gen 4. It barely drops commands and processes stuff swiftly, despite lacking the newer processor and other tech in the gen 4.As for the sound, well that part's subjective. I wasn't very into how bassy the tuning was, and how much audio processing there seemed to be. YMMV.I'm glad I didn't give up with the echo after my bad experience with the gen 4. Even my brief experience with the echo studio has painted clearly that Alexa is a capable and fast assistant-gen 4 just seems to be a poor hardware to support it. And judging by the recent barrage of low scoring reviews, I'm not alone.

My old security system was no longer functionining and I had been looking at smart hubs for some time now so when I saw this it fit several of my needs and has worked great. If anything it could have better hearing but I say that about myself also.... when I first heard the sound I had to check if it was already connected to my home theatre system as it was so much more than I wa used to from my dot. I’ve been using YoLink and eWeLink devices and they have integrated easily and work great with Alexa and provide many options if u want to get into programming ur own security scenarios.

I'm at the point where I have some variant of Echo in almost every room in the house, representing several generations of these products. I can say the sound is a big step up from the last generation Echo, but the microphones are a tremendous disappointment. Compared to the prior generation, it doesn't register my voice commands nearly as much and, when it does, it seems to have a higher error rate. I've tried to compensate by moving the device around or just rotating it at different angles, and the problems still exist. I'm seeing some similar comments in the reviews, so I have to conclude that Amazon just ""dropped the ball"" on this one (hilarious, I know.).Would not recommend. Instead spring for an Echo Studio (if you have the spot for a larger speaker) or an Echo Show 8 (if you don't mind the screen), as that model also has really nice sound but does not have the same microphone problems as this model. Or just wait until generation 5.EDIT: Amazon customer service (best in business, no doubt) called and tried to troubleshoot the device a bit. Doing a factory reset seemed to help slightly, but there is just no way this device hears me as well as previous generations or the other Echo iterations that I own.

The ability of Alexa to readily come up with information requested is nothing short of incredible. Almost all topics or questions put to it are answered, and the requests for various types of music and the speed that Alexa locates them with is unreal. I was amazed at the sound quality of music when I have the volume up loud...no breaking up of any kind and sounds like an expensive sound system. The only small drawback I have with the sound is the lack of better highs (treble) as my hearing is not so good with that and there is no tone control to adjust for that. Still have to discover more of the many uses for Alexa of which there are lots from what I read, so  it should be enjoyable. Great product!

I like the way it sounds. I really do. But the problem is, I can't even use it to listen to music at all. The problem traces back to very poor voice recognition.While you're playing music through the device, you may want to ask Alexa to control your home. But it can't hear you use the wake word at all. So I chose to have it connect to my old Creative Bluetooth speaker, which I have been using with Alexa since my old 2nd gen Echo dot from years ago. Sad really.But even with that Bluetooth speaker, the recognition of the wake word is so unstable. Sometimes I'm having a conversation on the phone or have the TV on (quite a bit of yards away at the opposite side of the room actually), it thinks it heard ""Alexa"", when really no one and nothing said it. I have no idea.Meanwhile, when I actually want to trigger it and I'm actually saying ""Alexa"", it's a hit or miss; either it won't react and I'll have to say it two or three more times, or it will actually work. It works about half the time. When it doesn't work, sometimes I have to scream ""Alexa"" louder and louder just to trigger the wake word. Sometimes it has to be so loud that my throat gets sore just from screaming the wake word.And in my experience, these frustrations I'm having are unique to this Echo 4th generation. I've also owned and used the Echo Dot 2nd Generation (which sounds awful on its own but see my comment about Bluetooth speaker above), and the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. Personally, I wish I just stuck with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. At least that one only got mistriggered (is that a word? Lol) whenever there was an Alexa ad on the TV.Overall, if you already own an Alexa device, I highly recommend you stay away from this because it'll feel like a downgrade.

I have multiple Echo devices, including an original Echo, 2nd gen Echo Dot, 3rd gen Echo Dot, and Echo Show.  The sound quality on this Echo is a clear step above the rest.  And I enjoy good sound- I have not inexpensive AV receiver and component speakers in my home theater system.  The new 4th gen Echo sounds much more dynamic than any of the other Echo devices I've heard.  In fact, it even has actual, honest to goodness, bass presence.  I read the reviews on this new Echo, and decided to get one based on the raves that I saw regarding its audio quality, so I was expecting it to sound better than my other Echo devices.  But it still managed to impress me.  It's that good.

I was a little concerned by some of the reviews that didn't like the shape or the sound dynamic, but where I have it in my bedroom, it works great.

Ordered the new Echo and it is much larger than expected. It's larger than a softball and not nearly as sleek as previous Echo units. It is VERY obvious in the room. The overall sound is much improved and its voice recognition seems on par with other Alexa devices. It has repeatedly disappointed me with its seeming inability to play Spotify playlists when specifically requested. Unlike previous Echo devices, it also seems unable to be used as a playback device from within Spotify, as the phone app continuously tries to connect with the Echo to no avail. Meanwhile, the music plays from my phone and all the other Echo devices that I own - from 1st-gen Echo to last-gen Dot - are available and ready to play the music. Just in the wrong room. A disappointment.

I got the replacement speaker today and it sounds completely fine and much more clear. So if you get one that sounds like the speaker is in a trash can, try exchanging it. Shouldn't have to do that as they should all be the same when they are brand new, but it is what it is.

Works well, just like every other Alexa product.  I was hoping for a little better sound - still has that bit of “muddy” sound that my Echo dots have.  Also, I bought two to have in stereo combo.  Linking them was easy; however, I did not know that there was no way to adjust balance, which is quite a bummer.  May add the matching sub in the future. If I do, I’ll update this review.

Well we cavedAlexa welcome homePretty much music and fun so farThe sound quality has been greatShe’s a bit rusty with the volume so that’s been oddAlso getting her to recognize the music requests? Our albums are there .Amazon support was great .So far so goodShe’s quick to answer questions .So all good I don’t know how I went this long without her?Only one downside? Why no dark cord? For the black ? Work on that amazon, I know you have it for the kindles.

The new Echo (4th Gen) is a great product.  The sound is fantastic.  I love the the new smart home hub capability.  I was able to switch over all my Link light bulbs with no issues at all, and there is no monthly fee.  Now the only downside is that the new hub capability cannot talk directly to Z-Wave products.  But there are other Z-wave hub units out there that do not have a monthly fee and they talk directly to Alexa.I did have a few questions on how to use and manage the new light devices on Alexa, and the Technical Support was very easy to get in touch with and very  knowledgeable.  I would highly recommend this product!!!!

I am in love with my Alexa, I love the superior sound and the fact that I can access my weather at any time by just asking the store list is amazing and I’m still learning of what else I can do with my echo, but I’m definitely excited and I can’t wait to figure out what else I can do with it

I loved my first Echo.  It informed me of the weather first thing in the morning, opened my favorite NPR radio station, and I was off and running.  At times during the day I'd play several of my favorite songs, songs from my library, or stream songs from my favorite artist.  The 4th gen Echo has a more artistic appeal, but it's sound quality is much improved over the first echo.  They are a joy to listen to.  I've had Bose too.  It's not a Bose.  But it does have a very pleasing quality, and can do so many other things - I think it's a bargain!!!

We recently bought the 4 generation Echo and love it! We can ask it to play all different types of music and it sounds like it has surround sound.

Love Alexa! She hasn't recognized my voice yet after a few weeks of having her and talking to her often,but hopefully with time she will. Sound is pretty loud. Love how I can control her from my phone even if I'm not home. I can send messages to the kids at home if I needed to through Alexa. Also, another great thing is that my son found out he can tell alexa to call me without him having a phone. She calls under a private number but he calls me all the time through her. The volume, well, I still can't figure out how loud is volume two of volume four. So I just just tell her repeatedly volume up or volume down. I couldn't wait to get her home. Love it!

Being an old hippy I am sometime resistant to new tech. I always laugh at all the gizmos my 30 year olddaughter has in her home. Its like George Jetson. Alexa turn on the lights, Alexa play Christmas music, Alexa add milk to the shopping list.......on and on. Well, our old stereo died and we wanted to replace it. I always liked the sound from my daughters ""hockey pucks"" not nearly as good as my old stereo but acceptable. My wife talked me into trying a pair of smart speakers. The larger 4th gen that look like the ""fully functional Death Star"" were on sale. So we bought a pair and are very happy with them. They sound great. Decent bass and volume and add milk to our shopping list, Lol. Rad man.

I replaced a 1st gen echo with this 4th gen. I was very happy with 1st gen which was mated to the smatree rechargeable base. The 1st gen echo finally stopped working suddenly after 4 years of heavy use indoor and outdoor on terrace ( 6 hours per day average).I was skeptical of the sound ability when I saw the dimensions of the 4th gen.  Once 4th gen arrived I was in awe of the product from superior sound ( upward sub), ergonomics, and material.I also own an echo studio and two show 5's. The 4th gen rivals the studio in sound.I mated the 4th gen with the Amazon Mission rechargable base.Amazon knocked it out of the park on this one.  Thank you.

This version of the Echo definitely has much better sound quality than the previous version. The round shape takes up less space and, in my opinion, looks better than the previous version. I also like that I can now play Apple Music on the device (though this feature is not exclusive to this device).The drawbacks are the the speaker sounds best when you are directly in front of it, so you may have issues trying to decide on the best placement for the speaker. Also, the mics seem to be a bit less responsive (the wake word is not as easily picked up in this version). Apart for those minor issue, it is a great device.

Very easy to install particularly if this Echo was preregistered to you by Amazon. The sound has been improved from the previous model Echo and very much improved from the Echo Dot.

The main reason I bought this was for my husband. My husband has a hard time hearing when we use the TV built-in speakers especially when the show has music that is so loud it drowns out the voices. I hooked it up paired it through the Alexa app, and changed the preferred speakers to Echo, and still, the TV sound would not come out of the Echo. I called support and after she put me on hold several times, she came back and had me blue-tooth the Echo to the TV through the Settings menu. After that, the sound did come out of the Echo, but the sound quality is so quiet I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it, which made it still not as loud as the TV speakers. With the volume all the way up, Alexa is extremely loud. I called tech support again to ask if there is a way to turn down just Alexa's voice so it is not booming. There is not. One more note...Echo Alexa does not always understand commands. You have to say, Alexa, turn on FireTV...because if you say Turn on the TV, it just says that feature is not available...or something to that effect. Pretty awful. Returning it.

When you buy this product it's weight and circular design makes it not stable at all. It does have a screw in adapter on the bottom that some sort of stand can be inserted but associate did not mention nor was there anything written on the box it comes in to let you know and no ""stands"" near product to sell. Alexa at times does not get right response from your requests and has already fallen twice off a chair when using outside.

 My house is thumping and my family absolutely loves all the music throughout our home! We also subscribe to Prime Family Music, so the variety of music options in our home is limitless.I have two 4th generation echos. One is twilight blue, the other is red. Both have beautiful sound. On top of that, I have seven 4th generation echo dots (all twilight blue) throughout my home. The regular echos have much better sound quality, but the echo dots are more affordable, and compliment the echos quite well. Both actually sound waaaay better than I anticipated! My kids think I am addicted to echos! I think they are right! I’ll probably buy more....oh boy

The awesome sound of this new Echo is perfection. The audio is superb. That being said, all the reviews about the “new” microphone sensitivity are true. The mic is awful.

So, on its own, the new Echo 4th Gen. only sounds marginally better then my 1st Gen.  Combining it with the Echo Subwoofer makes for a pretty good sound.  Since my 1st Gen Echo did not support the Sub, upgrading was worth the cost.  One problem I have encountered is that the ring light on the new device is at the bottom of the sphere making it difficult to see from some parts of the room.  All and all, I am pleased with the upgrade but had I not added the sub, I would have concluded that the sound was just ok, not much better then my Gen 1 Echo.

Alexa is overall a great thing to add to your room, but sometimes it glitches out (at least for me). I set an alarm but Alexa didn’t wake me and I was late for school. But after replugging it back in , its been fine. So I’m giving it 4 stars :)

I replaced a several year old cylinder style Echo with a new 4th gen (the old one died). This version is worse in pretty much every way. Specifically, the voice recognition is way worse. I frequently have to issue a command several times, with the key seeming to be artificially lowering my (male) voice, and making sure I leave a slight pause between ""alexa"" and the command. I was impressed with the previous Echo's recognition and came it rely on it for controlling lights and more. This version is often frustrating to use. I would not buy this again. A friend of mine has this same version and has the same problem.The sound quality is pretty subjective, but this version has more bass, but doesn't actually sound any better. Music is listenable, but still pretty poor--similar to before. I turned down the bass in the EQ to make it more balanced.The volume buttons are also worse than the old rotating control. The lights on the bottom are harder to see than the old ones on top (especially when changing volume and looking directly down). Aesthetically it looks OK, but ""stands out"" more and takes up more space, so the old style was more practical.

I love this little girl! I got the one with premium sound and it does deliver that. There’s so much you can do with this unit! No big and bulky stereo to deal with and all the add-ons you can use, it is a great value and I’m more then pleased with it.

This is a significant advancement from the original Echo.  With one exception.Sound quality is very good and an improvement on the original (which wan't at all bad...)Voice recognition seems to be better, but it processes a bit too fast, so if you speak slowly, it may guess what you want before you finish.I only gave it 4 stars because of one glaring ommision:  NO REMOTE!I use my remote on my old one all the time to pause when someone comes in the room, or to skip to the next song or news story.  I REALLY miss the remote.  If one becomes available before my return date, I'll order it.  Otherwise this is going back.

The voice recognition is good.  My problem is I have a memory problem.  So sometimes I have to stop and think about what I need to say.  Before I can continue it give me a partial answer or make me forget everything I was going to say.  I got this to remember things for me.  Not working out like I planned.  My kiddos love it.  They use it often to help with word descriptions.  I love the news of the day and the drop in feature.

I wanted an under-the-cabinet radio but those aren't so easy to come by so I opted for my Alexa.  What a great ""toy!""  The sound is just wonderful, easy set-up, Alexa takes up very little space, AND she responds beautifully to requests.  She even sang Happy Birthday to me when I asked her to!! This has been delightful experience and I'm glad we decided on this item.  I haven't integrated her with very many other related items but may get into that at a later date.  Great value/Great price!

I purchased a pair to have a convenient little stereo setup in the bedroom.  Had a bit of an issue getting both on the same Wi-Fi band. One of them kept bypassing the ""select your network"" prompt and defaulted to the 2.4ghz band.  After a few tries everything was assigned to 5g and paired smoothly. They aren't going to rock the place, but are ideal for a nightstand and late night tunes before bed.  Kick drum lacks authority but bass guitar notes are all evenly present, no hollow notes or bloom. For now I'm holding off on the echo sub.  I would like to see that stepped up to at least an 8"" but 10"" would be AWESOME!

I bought this primarily to listen to SiriusXM inside my house/back porch or even outside and it was sort of a fun gift to myself.  Well, it has been fun asking Alexa to play songs from the SiriusXM channels and just individual artists/groups.  Spent all day Sunday seeing if I could stump Alexa....but no dice!!  I wasn't expecting superior sound, and this won't provide a superior sound, but it's perfectly fine for the purpose I got it for.  I'm sure I'll eventually use it for other tasks as I learn more about its capabilities.  It is fun, for sure!

And notify you of breaking glass or fire alarms going off in your home while you are gone, thru text. When you come home simply say "" Alexa Im home"". And she stops guarding your home.

I thought the sound quality was great with this speaker. I really like having Alexa in our house. We have an echo studio as well and a number of dots. My only complaints are more about the system rather than the echo itself. We created groups, but a lot of times it has trouble starting music in a particular group. Also, I really wish that it could play audible books in the groups, but it only allows me to do that on individual speakers. Overall, I’m very happy with things, but there are some quirks and it certainly doesn’t run perfectly.

I must say that there’s very little, if anything, to dislike about this all-new and all-powerful sphere known as the fourth generationEcho. Spheres are the shape of the future, and this proves it.  sure, it’s a little bulky, but who cares when you get such a good sound quality out of it!  I would dare say that the sound quality is on par with my Bose speakers, which I highly doubt when it comes to Bluetooth speakers.  Alexa integration? Who can beat that! And, a built-in smart home hub? That really is the proverbial cherry on top.  i’d say you get a whole lot for your money.  And who would’ve thought so much good could come in a sphere?

I had a first generation Echo, which I liked alot.  I decided to upgrade to this new model for aesthetics and because I assumed it would have better sound.  While it does sound slightly better (seems to have more bass), the voice recognition doesn't work nearly as well.  I find that I often have to shout at Alexa several times before it responds.  I'm not sure why this is the case, but I think it's because the microphones are now at the base of the unit, right touching up to the desk, rather than high up on the unit.  I'm undecided whether the upgrade was worth it.

For the price (bought it during Prime Day) it’s not a bad little speaker. I’d demand more from a home theater setup, but I’d pay a lot more for that.

Sometimes I have to get pretty close to set a timer, but it could be its placement on the counter.

I upgraded from a 1st generation Echo to 4th generation to use the internal temperature sensor to control fans. The temperature control functionality is unuseful. It seems to require the temperature to cross the setpoint before triggering an action. For example, if the temperature setpoint is 75 degrees and its 76 degrees, the action will not trigger. It only triggers when the temperature drops below 75 degrees and then increases back to 76 degrees. This is useless logic for temperature controllers, but apparently a legacy problem. I rated two stars because this amounts to false advertising. Otherwise I have been using Echos for years and I am satisfied with most capabilities.I also tried integrating a Hubitat controller with Alexa to send a virtual switch. Unfortunately Alexa routine triggers are limited to schedule and temperature sensor. Alexa will not allow the virtual switch as a trigger.12/20/20 Update:Amazon tech support called me after reading this review. They suggested including all devices in the routine which didn't fix the issue. We also tried deleting and adding back the routine. We tried a schedule trigger instead of a temperature trigger which did work. Basically temperature routines don't work. Today I successfully paired an external zigbee temperature sensor. Temperature based routines still don't work.

This is our 1st Echo and waited for the new generation with enhanced speakers/ sound. Im glad we waited.  Easy to use and very loud when playing music or answering questions.

His speech is impaired but he loved trying to sing music and teller her to stop :-) he gets a little frustrated Alexa doesn't sometimes understand but he keeps talking to her which is fantastic to open his speech.

I bought this to replace my Wink hub which has suffered outages of over a week. I got this and setup was very easy just like my 4 other echo devices.  I think they missed the boat on this hub. It does WiFi devices and zigbee devices. It does NOT do zwave devices. Why wouldn’t they?  As a result I had to replace all of my Leviton wall switches and dimmers. At over $35 a switch, it was expensive.  Luckily Leviton has these devices in WiFi.  This hub needs a little better range. This echo device doesn’t hear very well either. That is why only 4 stars.

Works well for a smaller bedroom but can have trouble hearing your voice if you call Alexa in a lower normal voice.Alexa definately needs YouTube music integration. I already had playlists set up and feel like I'm being forced to use other apps like Amazon music unlimited to have the same access.Bluetooth works fine for music but would be nice for it to have low latency bt features so you can use the good audio quality for an alternate tv audio source without the delay when watching a movie or show.Pretty satisfied but I think this should have been no more than 49.99.

My office Alexa failed when it was 6 days out of warranty. I replaced it with this one. Great sound. Excellent voice recognition. In 3 weeks it has locked up 2X, requiring factory reset. I ordered the 2 year protection plan the same day and it has not arrived (chasing that today). FWIW I run my office Alexa daily. Audio mostly, 3-4 hours per day when I'm not in meetings so the occasional reset need is not unexpected.

I recently upgraded from the Echo 3rd generation to the 4th.  The positives are:  better sound quality for music and a faster response time for many of the commands.  Negatives are:  this Echo does not 'hear' nearly as well.  Often, even when close by it won't hear us say 'Alexa...' and if we are more than 10 feet away, we have to shout to get it to hear.  So if you have one of these primarily to play music and it's always close by, then it's probably worth upgrading.  But using it for other functions or if it's not so close, probably not.

After having use this device for about a year it stopped  connecting to Amazon servers.  After several hours of attempting the various fixes shown on the web to reconnect Internet, I contacted Amazon the following day and discovered that Amazon had without notice or consent transferred my device serial number to an unrelated persons account making the device unusable for me. Over the past several days I have tried to get a response to fix this or simply send a new device but Amazon has yet to contact me back with a solution.  Obviously that’s the problem because it makes the device completely unusable. But it also raises legitimate security and privacy concerns about how a device could be transferred to another account and why there was no process for providing notification and consent to approve such transfer. This seems to be a serious problem, that concerns me given that I have numerous Amazon devices.I encourage other customers to ask questions regarding their security and ability to protect the devices from being transferred before they purchase.  I will update if Amazon solves this problem and identifies how it happened.

We have a Sonos speaker (a few years old) and I think this Alexa sounds better. I love that you can set up routines with voice command or by time. The kids have fun asking her questions and she seems to recognize words better than other versions. Or maybe the kids are older and speak clearer!!

Hi, my name is klaw. I am fine, how are you?I'm returning the echos i bought. They arrived not but an hour ago. Futility is the mantra when it comes to the set up and pairing of these two thingies. The end result is no device pairing and an hour of wasted time.  Time which probably would have been more enjoyably spent staring at the wall. Try wall staring if you have not!! It's much more enjoyable than trying to set up echos! lol. Imho, the echo is horrible.Please pass this feedback on to the manufacturer: ""The echo is a LAME, and intolerable device whose insolence should not be tolerated. It is a de-evolutionary system and therefore a total step back from previous versions. I am returning both echos i bought after an hour of futility spent attempting to set them up. You should abandon this version and give them away gratis to people who enjoy bad technology.""Note to potential  echo buyers out there: If you are into music and are desirous of a new system, do yourself a favor and buy yourself a sonos. Or multiple soni (sp?) I already have sonos and the set up is a breeze.  It's like uncorking a bottle and watching spellbound as Barbara Eden floats out. Truth.I was lured into trying this ""next gen"" echo because of the bargain basement pricing. There is a reason for this. An hour of my billable time is far more valuable than the price of the echo, and since I'm in the tech industry for a living, I don't need the aggravation of battling yet another system in my spare time.These speakers should deploy and set up almost ""automagically"" since they have the weighty support of Amazon's legions of engineers to back up the design. This is not the case. These speakers should bear a big red label reading ""Warning Lame Tech Inside. Proceed at your own risk. Perhaps you would be better off staring at the wall.""Thank you.This has been a public service announcement.

The Echo 4th Gen is a cute cube shape and music sounds rich and full with the usual full Alexa support. Bass is quite good for its size and sounds best in rooms that are small to medium size, but can of course be placed anywhere in the home. I have the Echo Studios as well, which are the best sounding, but the the Echo 4th gen is 2nd to only the Studio in sound. I also added in the battery base and that is must for portability. I use this Echo in the office and then outside on the balcony without having to find a plug for it and reboot. The battery lasts about 4 hours and charges automatically when plugged back in.

Just received this yesterday, so don't have a lot to say yet, but it does sound good. However, I am disappointed that I was sent a white cord to go with my charcoal Echo. I wanted it to look inconspicuous on my hallway and blend in, but the white cord makes that pretty difficult. I would have preferred a black cord.

I’ve had an Echo Dot for a little over a year with little trouble. I recently upgraded to the Echo for the premium sound. After about a month I’m quite disappointed. Voice recognition is not nearly as accurate as the Dot. It comes on without a wake up more often than the Dot. Does not understand requests as accurately as the Dot and starts playing random music when asking it an unrelated question. I literally almost smashed it once because it WOULD NOT listen to anything I was asking, it would just say,”Ok, here’s music by____”.  The ONLY advantage of the Echo over the Dot is the sound is slightly better but not $50 better. Overall the Echo should not sell for more than $50-60.

We have an expensive Alexa enabled Bose speaker and it is terrible as far as integration with Amazon music.  I finally gave up and bought an Echo.  It was far cheaper and works beautifully.

I am an audiophile I have a high-end system.  stile I do not need it all the time.  This device plays a lot of pop music just fine and is perfect for podcasts.  With casual listening, you need a quality system to listen without is tiring you.  I find I can listen to my favorite podcast just fine without the sound tiring me.  It has one weakness,  the reminder feature seems sometimes to start it on the last podcast it was on once the reminder is invoked.  I am sure the elves in Amazone IT will fix this small bug soon.

I now have 3 of these. That's right, I didn't learn my lesson after the first one!As for the sound, it is good. The bass is deeper than my old echo and sounds a bit over processed, but it's fine. I can easily listen to music which is what I use the Echo for primarily.As for the microphone, like others have stated, it is horrible!!! My son has an Echo dot in his room. We had the Echo 2nd gen in our bedroom. There are times I will be standing next to the 4th gen slowly screaming at it. It will just spin, stop, spin, stop, and then play something totally incorrect. I will walk into my bedroom on the other side of the house and my 2nd gen will be doing exactly what I was trying to get this one to do! It does okay in totally silent rooms. As soon as there is any sound at all, good luck!

I have the first gen and second gen Echo and the new fourth gen blows them both away! Improved audio and solid wi-fi connectivity are the two winning features as far as I'm concerned.

Compared to the 3rd gen, this version has a slightly better sound, but not sure the difference is good enough to go from the 3rd gen to the 4th gen if you can't afford it.I absolutely love the spherical design, but the biggest issue I'm running into is listening.  I'm constantly having to repeat commands; 2 sometimes 3 times even when I'm speaking directly towards the device.  It's a bit irritating especially when I want to snooze the morning alarm.  I practically have to yell at the device 3 times to ""snooze"".. by then the adrenaline of having to yell at her wakes me up.. so I shouldn't bother snoozing anymore.It's not just the morning alarm, it's all commands.

It’s a very nice device I love the color, the only thing I don’t like is that the cord is white, I think the cord should be the same color as the device. also there is a stand you can buy  for  ECHO 4TH GENERATION, but it only just sits on the top of it and it could move and fall over if you touch it to change volume. These are third-party accessories.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

Doesnt recognize my voice like I thought it said it would. Theres a lot learning Alexa has to do. Was it worth the about $100? Maybe still deciding. Its cool it does have guard mode.

The sound of the new Echo is great by comparison to the second gen. Good base for a small unit that doesn’t crackle like the past ones did. Placed in the right spot you don’t even need an echo sub cause the base is deep enough to render through the space. Very happy with this generation

I bought this for one reason only--to listen to music--specifically Amazon music.  You'd think that was a no brainer, I mean Amazon Echo, Amazon Music, what could go wrong?  I AirPlayed Amazon music for years through my Apple TV, until Apple dropped the Toslink connection from the 4K TV, making it impossible to play it directly through my receiver without having to turn on my TV.  Amazon has this on sale, so why not give it a try? 20 minutes--that's about all I can get from the echo before it decides to stop playing and I have to reboot the echo by unplugging and re-plugging the power cable.--I can't even get Alexa to reboot herself.  I bought a sound bar with HDMI passthrough and went back to Apple TV.  I guess if you want to have a conversation with Alexa, maybe this is the device for you.  C'mon Jeff, you guys can do better than this.

I am considerably happy with this product.  No, I don't expect it to sound like a 1000 watt stereo system, but the sound is solid.  I got one specifically because I bought an alexa-abled Christmas tree, and we put the echo in the kitchen.  Now I want about 8 more layered all over the house.

I bought this Echo 4 Gen with a pair of Phillips Hue Light bulbs because i relocate to another place and wanted to start integrating convenience into my new home.  This Echo product has a built-in Hub which enables control of all kinds of devices such as the Family Room shown here.  I simply ask Alexa to turn lights on and it's done.  I can dim the lights to any percentage with a simple command.  It works so well, I bought another pair of Phillips Hue bulbs to use in my Home Office.  With a simple command I now can control lights from just about anywhere Alexa can hear my voice.  I'll be integrating other Alexa devices soon.

This was our first foray into the Echo universe, and we are well-pleased. The setup was a bit hitchy, but the few stumbling blocks were quickly solved with an unplug/replug. The voice recognition is amazing, and the variety of things it can do is surprisingly vast. The sound while playing music is rich and full, but don’t expect it to sound like a $600 Bose Wave or Cambridge SoundWorks system. It tends to break up at high volume. But for its price, and given its features, it is amazing. So much so that after setting up our first one, we ordered two more. One for each bedroom, and one for the living room. 100% recommend.

My older Echo was starting to fail. It refused to play full albums of music, and had other quirks unique to it. I upgraded to the new Echo. The issues I was having have been fixed by the new model.In order to activate Echo, I need to speak noticeably louder than I used to. This is an annoyance and I don't see a place where I can adjust this. The sound quality doesn't seem to be quite as good as the older model. It's good, but it's missing something. Lastly, the sphere shape takes up more room than the cylinder did. Not a big deal, but just saying.

I thought the sound would be a bit better. There's too much base in contrast to the treble even when the base is turned way down. Overall, music sounds muffled. Other than that, I love that the hub is directly built in and all I have to do is screw a Phillip's hue light bulb into my lamp - sync it to my kindle fire - and I have voice command over light. Too cool. It also seems to recognize voice commands better than older versions, although for sound and quality I still think the original Alexa back in 2014 is best. Which, btw, still works perfectly.

I got these a few years ago for surround sound for my tv. They worked ok for a month or so and would randomly disconnect so I stopped using them for that purpose and used them for multi room sound. It was fine for a while and they would disconnect occasionally but now they won't connect at all. I spent 2 hours trying to fix the issue myself before contacting support then nearly 2 more hours with support and still no resolution. They said they would contact me in 5-7 business days so who knows...My other issues with the devices are that they never seem to understand anything I say. I had the old echo dots and had very few issues with them understanding me. One would assume the newer more expensive devices would work better, right? with these I commonly get the response ""I'm sorry, I didn't get that"" or ""something went wrong."" My favorite was when I asked to turn the lights down and Alexa played me the song Mr Grinch. When I ask to adjust the thermostat she will either play some random song or tell me that I'm 2.2 miles from the city I live in. Other voice commands give equally random results.Also, one of my devices started reporting the room temperature in °C instead of °F out of the blue one day. If I asked for the outside temp or the other rooms temp, it would respond in °F, but the room I was in was °C. I spent 2 hours with support resetting the device, adjusting settings and restarting the router before giving up and swapping that device for one in another room.If you want a device that doesn't do what it's advertised to do and does do random stuff when you ask for something, then this is the device for you.

I really like the gen 4 echo. The sound is much richer than the previous amazon echoes. I'm getting used to the new shape. I did like the cylindrical shape of the older models.  Adjusting the volume was much easier on the older models.  You got to get used to using the push buttons on top to make adjustments.  I know I can Alexa to make volume changes. But when I'm trying to fall asleep listening to music, It doesn't make much sense to speak to it. But it didn't make sense to reach out and turn the top ring either. I have my 4th gen echo paired with the Amazon sub and boy does it sound good. Highly recommend the new 4th gen echo.

The app is clunky. If you have a ""household"" prepare for a nightmare when you want to set up audio by room or everywhere if not everyone lives in the same house despite different accounts.Devices don't connect simultaneously (i.e. turn lights on) and audio splitting is laggy. Connects to my phone, but doesn't always make calls from it when I ask-- its capable, its done it, it just doesn't ALWAYS do it even with an exact command.Can't get it to connect to my Bluetooth stereo, won't connect to my tvs even though it can find them. Can't always control my firesticks and she says they don't exist under voice command but can control from app.Other than that-- the device itself has excellent audio quality-- I'm picking it over my 5.1 stereo half the time. Blueprints are dope for getting her to say whatever I want as long as I can figure out a proper phonetic spelling. Its a cool gadget, just doesn't deliver all as promised.I have a lot of hair ripping moments, and a lot of future is now moments with this device. I see the potential, its just taking a lot more tweaking and tech know-how than I expected.

Central hub for Alexa Smart Home, used in conjunction with Alexa Echo Dots in office and bedroom.  Using your Alexa Echo/dot is very addicting, especially when getting information on time, temperature, weather forecast, and news.  No fumbling for glasses to see the clock, just lie in bed and ask.Think carefully when choosing your Echo's color. I am planning on getting a second Echo in white as it will blend in better with living room décor.  I will link the two Echos for a Living Room stereophonic experience.

I have this echo in my bedroom along with an echo dot third gen I believe. My boyfriend loves this thing just as much as I do, and we constantly are using them both to listen to music, and audio books. The echo has a nice rich sound that I enjoy a lot. The buttons are easy to find, and identify, plus any person will be able to manipulate the device without actively looking at it because of the tactile buttons. It's also a must have for any blind or visually impaired music lover because from start to end, this device is completely accessible along with the alexa app. It stays put on a table or other hard surface, but doesn't stay put on a bed easily.

I was amazed at the big sound coming from this new Echo.  The bass response is really surprising.  In fact, for some music I find myself turning down the bass frequencies slightly using the Alexa equalizer settings on my smart phone.  I mostly listen to the Sirius classical music station, and the sound quality is richer than I expected.  I may be crazy, but it almost seems as if there is stereo separation in the music.  I suppose that true stereo would require two of these new Echos, and I am seriously considering buying another one to test this theory.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this new echo to anyone looking for a voice-activated speaker with great sound.

Alexa was having a hard time understanding me, and people could barely hear me using the communication functions, even if I was extremely close to the echo. Also, this is subjective, but I think the sound quality for music is not great. It has a lot of bass, and a lot of treble, but they don't mix together well. It seems like whenever a song gets to a part with with mostly higher frequencies, the bass just drops out, it's very distracting. I tried messing with the equalizer, but I never could get it to sound right. Not really a fan of the whole sphere thing either, but that's also subjective. I'm just sticking with echo dots from now on, they may be lacking in bass, but at least they have a cohesive sound, and a microphone that actually works.

My 12 year old was hesitant to ask me if he could take the coffee maker whenever he moves out. I said to him, bro, when you move out you'll be able to THINK about coffee and your new coffee maker will be able to deliver.But guess what?! Now we can just ask Alexa to do it and she will.I have an aging mother, and I also got Alexa so mother would not have to fight with her iPhone to do things, she can just ask Alexa to play the music she loves without any hassle.If you are on the fence about this but like technology and smart homes, this is the cherry on top.

The device works great and my parents love their Christmas gift.  Unfortunately, the advertised free 6 mos of Amazon music goes on the purchasers account and there is no way for the gift recipient to get the music promo.  Very frustrating to find that it was credited to my account and after a phone call and an agent chat, that there is no work around for this.  The music should not be bundled with the item, because I can't be the only person on the planet that gave the Alexa as a gift.  Very frustrating. How hard can it be to credit a different email account with the music gift?

I have had the Alexa tower since it was launched.  Decided to upgrade to this new version based on reviews.  Sound quality is better — if you are in the directional range of the sound.  The new ‘directional speaker’ creates zones of good sound vs muffled sound.  It also creates dead spots in your room where Alexa can not hear your commands.  If your home has an open design concept — you will have to position this Alexa to maximize the focused speaker.  The older Alexa tower with 360 speaker/mic does better in an open concept home.

This speaker is my my first venture into listening to music in this way. The price I paid was reasonable,  and I love having such variety in such a simple form! Sometimes I listen to specific artists, other times the stations provide a wide range of music I can enjoy. I haven't purchased the unlimited music that is offered, but variety is still good.

I wouldn't buy any echo device again.  I have 4, one is this model. All of them are very glitchy about when they work. Sometimes alexa says it will play music and then nothing happens,  mostly it plays something completely different than what you say. It's so frustrating to have purchased something that works so terribly.  It got worse and worse as time goes on, I've had almost 2 months now and my window to return is over. I do not recommend purchasing an echo device.

I replaced two 3rd generation echos with two of these. The sound quality is better and I like the look and color of the globe. The voice recognition doesn't seem as good as the 3rd generation and I put these in the exact spots as the 3rd. I would give it 4 i/2 stars if I could as it is a great speaker for the price.

I replaced my old Pringles-can Echos with the new ball-style, and while they may look better and resist getting knocked over by my cat, they seem to have gotten worse at basic things like language comprehension. If I listen to the same 3 podcasts weekly, and I ask to hear the latest episode of one of those podcasts, how can Alexa constantly misunderstand and play some obscure podcast I've never heard before? Other times, I ask the Echo to do something basic like telling me the time, the blue light comes on for a second, but Alexa never says or does anything, not even ""Sorry, I didn't understand you."" The old Echos never did that.The real kicker, though, is the execrable ""by the way"" feature, which constantly asks me if I want to use some ability that I'm not interested in. I find myself actually getting mad and swearing at Alexa when she asks me if I want to try some inane, useless skill. If anyone at Amazon is actually listening to what I say to my Echo, then I apologize for my salty language. But if you continue to annoy me rather than assist me, then I'm going to move from swearing at my new Echos to throwing them in the trash and switching to Google's platform.

the sound is really great, as is design, build quality and features. however, I had a BT issue which made ime return it.when playing over Bluetooth for an extended period (3 hours), the BT connection remains active, but sound does not. I did an update, full reset and contacted Amazon tech support but to no avail or solution (a power down reestablishes the BT connection, but the issue remains and repeated itself after another 3 hrs of play)  For me, this was too important, and ended up returning the device for a refund.if you don't rely on a BT connection for your media, then this is a superb smart speaker.

I had essentially the same problems with the prior generation full sized echo with hub, and decided to return it for a refund.  I've had this unit for more than 6 months, but just now getting tired of it's deficiencies and decided to write a review. First off, the smart hub features seem to work fine. My issues are with voice recognition and audio quality. It's pretty crappy.I have a same generation Echo Dot across the room. Often if I'm standing immediately next to this larger Echo hub and say something to it, it doesn't respond, but the one 20 feet away across the room does. Sometimes I can make 2 back-to-back requests, standing next to the unit with my mouth facing it, and with the same voice volume - one of the requests will be answered by it and the other will be answered from the unit 20 feet away.I do not believe it is simply ""confusion"" between the two units.  Before I had the Dot, I would have experienced the hub unit simply not responding to my voice at all.Audio quality is terrible - I have a house full of Echo's including a 1st generation Echo.  It is very muffled, like if you turned up bass to the max, and treble to the min. It's almost as if it simply doesn't produce ANY high frequencies.  My same generation Echo dot, and 1st generation Echo sound FAR better. My Dot w/clock sounds fine.  but this unit, just like the prior edition hub sound like they are under a pillow.  and yes, I have adjusted bass down and treble up...tiny bit of improvement but it still sucks.

I got to where I had to link it to the Alexa app on my phone or tablet, which I hadn't counted on having to do, wasn't prepared, and somehow it all went to hell, and I never could get it to work. Hours later I gave up. If there were some way I could get help from Amazon I would welcome it, but don't know how.The above was my original review. I got a call a few hours later offering to help. So I pursued it. Talked to a human being and within 10 minutes we were resolved. And I have loved it. I have changed my attitude toward Amazon's customer service. Revelatory! Thanks.Frank

I purchased this device as an upgrade to my old Echo2 Dot, and to retire my Phillips Hue hub. First off, the sound quality of the Echo4 is amazing. The built in speakers produce phenomenal bass compared to the older echo2. In addition, the bi-directional headphone jack allows me to feed my non bluetooth device into it (the older Echo devices were output only). The built-in hub controls much cheaper smart lighting bluetooth bulbs, so I was able to save enough on the new bulbs over the comparable Hue bulbs to more than pay for the Echo4. All in all, very impressed with the Echo4.

Pros:The base response on the 4th generation Echo is excellent - so much better that the 1st or 2nd.

Wireless has intermittent connection. My other wireless devices have no connection issues.

As an author, the Alexa is a time saver! I'd be lost without it. The Alexa devices keep music playing in my office when I want it, set timers for me, keep my schedule organized, hold playlists for various books I'm writing so I can listen for inspiration at any time, and, my favorite, Alexa can define and spell anything I need at any time. She also offers synonyms, which is a major time saver while writing. I now have them in every house in every room. The Alexa app connects all my info, so no matter where I'm working, I have everything I need. Highly recommend for authors or anyone trying to stay organized in a busy world.

It would seem the only way to turn off ads is to cripple the device.  It's a shame, because otherwise this would be handy in my life.  As it is I find myself frustrated with it quite a bit.  It's like having a stranger chime up in my living room every once in a while about things they want to rip me off with.Great for timers, though that is very limited as well.I guess I would call the device 'smart lite'.  It reminds me of back when streaming was locked up by only a few companies and the interfaces really sucked.  At least that got a little better over the years, like skip options, etc. Alexa in it's current state feels crippled, crippled because Amazon can, not because it has to.As a device it's a single speaker so limited in it's application and basically a really expensive paper weight when the internet goes down or the amazon servers go down.

I use the Alexa features for Amazon music and some other things which works perfectly but the sound quality is good enough that I connect my PC or TV to it instead of my sound bar depending on what I’m doing.The microphone doesn’t show up but the speaker does on my Windows PC.

The Echo sounds good and works well.  My only complaint is that it's  like talking to someone who's hard of hearing.  You have to speak pretty loudly to it to get a response.

How could I not like this thing?! The sound is great, the things that you can do with an Alexa (get your head out the gutter here) are incredible. The reminders, the ability to ""drop in"", the ability to turn lights on/off is way more useful than I thought it would be. I truly can't believe I waited so long to get one of these things. If I had one complaint, it would be that it doesn't come with the battery base.

I bought two for stereo music and also for the home control functions which includes room temperature. At first I didn’t like the sound and felt its listening required.hearing aids. Purchasing inexpensive stands put the speakers at ear level and the sound is amazing. I also changed the response word to Echo which helps a little in listening issue. The echo one is the best listener and should be considered for olde people. I paid  about $120 for the pair Black Friday special. The bass is amazing but a subwoofer would add to the awesomeness. I am sure there is nothing like the Eccho 4 for sound and functionality.

Delivery was slow especially when I could buy at Best Buy but couldn’t get a timely delivery from Amazon! Voice recognition is not the best.  You have to line up to the device and also be fairly close.  Sound is a little (tenny) sounding.  I think the sound is better on my original Echo  version1.

I've owned Echos since the original Echo Dot.  3rd Gen Echo had better microphone pickup I guess.  If it hears me at all while I'm facing away from the little gray ball of frustration it often gets what I say wrong.

We were hoping to pair our new Alexa with the smaller Alexa Dot so the Dot would act as a speaker and play the same music as was being played on the Alexa in another room.  THESE TWO DO NOT PAIR.  You must buy two Alexa's or two Alexa Dot's in order to pair them to play the same playlist!!  This was not made clear- but now you know...The Alexa Dot is fine on it's own however- lots of good sound for a very small device!

Plugged Alex in and it worked great. We added some light to our living and bedroom and I was amazed at how easy it was to set them up. I also was able to add my Sony remote speaker very easily. The only thing I did not like was that I couldn't use both the Echo speaker and the Sony speaker at the same time but not a big deal. There are so many things you can do with Alexa that we are just learning every day. It is so nice just to sit down in the living room and ask Alex to play our favorite music on Pandora or turn the lights on or off and much more. Well worth the money.

Mic sensitivity is not as good as the Gen 3 echo, but sound quality is great. You just have to be closer or raise your voice to get Alexa to respond. I dont like you can't connect Alexa to YouTube.

I wouldn’t say “Premium Sound”, but I would say pretty dang good. I do like the stereo sound and Aux line in. It’s nice to not be limited to bluetooth or have to configure each time I want to use it for sound from my TV sources, as not to use surround sound or sound bar at night. I have a 25’ 1/8” audio cable coming from a DAC, from the Optical out on TV set. Maybe more complicated than most people would do, but I prefer wired and not bluetooth if I can. No delays and a more crisp sound.

Our ECHO (4TH Generation) was a Christmas present, and I cannot say enough wonderful things about having this device.  We subscribed to the Amazon Music feature, and get literally any music we want to hear.  Having the Echo hooked up to our Phillips Hue lightbulbs actually makes it fun to turn the lights on and off, as well as our Smart Plug, which we have on another lamp.  We never dreamed so much information would be at our finger tips..... just for the asking, not to mention reminders, routines, placing and tracking orders, etc.  We highly recommend this Echo 4th Generation to everyone!

I wish the Drop In feature could be independent from outbound calling.  I need to limit that calling & still be able to communicate via our other Amazon device but it is 'all or nothing'.

That's a real disappointment.Voice quality in the intercom feature Isbell the greatest.  As a speaker - it's primary function - and a connection to Amazon Music it works optimally.

I purchased this model in charcoal as an upgrade to the original model. I thought the original was having a harder time hearing me over the years, so I decided to get this model to replace it. The bad news for me is that it doesn't do as good as the older model in hearing what I say. I do feel the sound quality is better though and I am not at all unhappy with my purchase. As others have pointed out, I am dissatisfied that a white power cord is shipped with a charcoal device. It sticks out terribly. One day I will need to find a new cord...

I really like the sound quality of this generation of Echo. It’s significantly improved. It processing faster as well. The one thing is that it doesn’t seem to hear me as well when I say “Alexa”. Especially if there’s music playing, but even sometimes when it’s not. The older generation I had previous would practically pickup a whisper. It’s not a huge deal. Overall I’d say it’s worth having this over the others. Audio is a big deal for me, and I love the quick response time. The spherical shape is also a nice new touch. Gives it a more organic feel.

I had a first generation Echo that I exchanged to get this new echo. To my disappointment this one doesn’t listen well AT ALL. The sound quality it top notch, but her voice recognition and listening is terribly sub par.I’ve used it in 3 different spaces and that has made little difference. The only time she responds consistently is when I’m within 4 feet or really yell.In fact, my two echo dots ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE respond more consistently to me than this one does. I was literally 10 feet away from this echo and asked it to set a timer and both of my other echos (which have walls and hallways between me and them) responded to me and the one that had a clear line of sight and sound, didn’t even engage.If you’re looking for excellent sound, this will get the job done. If you’re looking for another child that doesn’t listen and often misunderstands what you said, this will also get the job done.I’d get the smaller echo dot clock before I’d get this, if my mom or grandma were to ask my opinion.

I have owned pretty much every generation of echo dot. This time I wanted to upgrade to see if the sound is really better. And it is! This speaker is great for playing music. The mic to wake up and voice recognition is also great.There is one major flaw why I returned the item. If you set a volume loud enough to hear Alexa well it will blow you away when you play music. If you turn it down so the music is not waking up the neighbors it is simply too low to hear Alexa. The echo dot is way better balanced. I wish there was a volume setting for voice and music.

Great but I bought this to replace a 3rd gen that died. However, 90% of the time. When playing music as part of a group with my existing 3rd gen, constantly fails to start playing or if it does, stops playing after a few songs.It's super frustrating to say the least. Have considered changing my 3rd gen out but seems ridiculous that it would have such trouble syncing a 4th gen with the 3rd gen.

We’ve had a 1st gen echo for last 5 years, and it’s still working great. Mostly use for music. This new echo really sounds great and has much richer range. Also hears quieter commands. Unlike many reviews, I don’t think it’s ugly and I like it’s look… of course, that depends on each person. It sounds so good, I may just get another one like it for stereo sound. Very happy with purchase! Oh, and found out there is a separate available rechargeable battery base to move it other places and outside, so there’s another possible plus to this model.

For what it’s worth, I like it. Not bad for $60 ($40 off from $100).Only issue I have is, well, sometimes it’s annoying when you say “Alexa”, and it doesn’t hear you.. And it’s even more annoying when you keep repeating “Alexa” in the exact same tone, then after 5 times of repeating “Alexa”, it finally hears you. I don’t understand why it couldn’t hear me the first time, or even the first 4 times. Other than that, I like the virtual home assistance. It’s definitely better than my iPhone’s Siri. It turns on and off my lights with ease, and has great sound when playing music.

We bought the echo about 6 months ago.  We were impressed with the sound quality of the echo, the depth of sound is pretty good.However!  The quality of the sound is moot when you can’t get the device to actually play music.  This is the most glitchy device I have ever purchased.  We’ve had issues from the beginning.  I would have to reconnect it to the wifi almost daily, sometimes restarting my router just to get the stupid thing to reconnect, even though every other device in the home was connected.Ok, maybe there was something wrong with the signal of our router, so we purchased google routers and placed them all over our house to broadcast the signal better.  I guess that worked because we haven’t had Alexa tell us she’s not connected to the internet anymore.  But NOW she just won’t play music whenever she doesn’t feel like doing it.  In order to get the echo play music nowadays we have to unplug it for a minute and then plug it back in and that will last for a while. If we have music playing in the background for a couple of hours, you can tell when it needs to be unplugged and plugged back in because it will just decide to stop playing music for no reason.Would have returned it right away and given it one star if the sound quality was garbage.  But my husband is willing to put up with it because while it’s working, after all the screwballing around to get it to work, it sounds great.

I love that I can bridge to my blinds but other than that I think it stinks. It fails to hear half my commands and gets them incorrect more often than not if it hears me. I have moved it out of my living room and returned my Echo Dot (3rd Gen) to the living room and put it in my least used location

I love the fact that I can ask Alexa to play any music genre I request, any radio station and questions on a lot of subjects. I can ask Alexa to play volume 1 for low or 2 to 10 for a louder volume. I don't have to move a finger. It's an amazing addition to my apartment.My Echo is a Bose speaker and Alexa wrapped up in one. It's an excellent addition to my home. I love my Echoes. I'm very happy with my purchases. I bought 3. One for my patio' dining room and bedroom. 😊👌

How hard is it to make a “hub” that actually has all the functionality of a “hub”. WiFi, BT, Zigbee and Z-w nope. If a crappy company like wink can do it and then fail at being a crappy company, surely Amazon could do this in the dark.The device does what it’s supposed to although the sound isn’t better than my echo 2nd gen and the white cord on a black device is just a miss.We put a rover on Mars and missed by a whole 16 meters but whole home automation is still a galaxy away....

Bought a pair of these to replace my surround sound because I didn't like the way I couldn't hear the voices on my movies very well. I can say these are perfect and sound amazing. I have one sitting on each end table of my couch and its just perfect. The sound awesome, the voices are crystal clear and the background sounds are perfect. I put them in a group and then via wifi connected them to my fire cube and its really good. I wouldn't even waste my time or money with sound bars or running speaker wire with any other system. These sounds as well if not better than the high quality wireless speakers available.

I am hearing impaired so I use a Bluetooth link between my Echo and my TV. The speaker is placed near my hearing ear so I don't have to blast the internal TV speaker.

The sound quality is better than our current Amazon Echo 3rd generation speaker, especially the bass.

To start off, as an Echo it functions great like you would expect and others I have had before it.Unfortunately, It is very big and very ugly.  It is like a cloth looking ball.  Who wants that in your living room to see all the time.  The best was the 2nd gen, it is a short cylinder and I have the walnut dark brown version.  It looks good to have in a living room.  The 4th gen ball does not.  It won't even fit where I have my current one.  A very poor design decision.  Took off 2 starts for that.

The 4th generation Echo is a great sounding device and looks great, except... the Charcoal colored Echo comes with a white cord!

This produces room filling sound, and the little sub-woofer kicks. A good overall value. You would have to pay $100-200 more to get better sound in this category in my experience. Just wish the Alexa was a bit less sketchy. Half the time it takes off playing something that has nothing to do with what you asked for. Some songs are just impossible to find. Try ""Alexa play Frankie Beverly and Maze 'Souhern Girl""""No, it is not audiophile quality. But if you are getting your source music over the Internet you aren't in to that to begin with. A very good compromise.

I love the sound and the deep rich bass, only thing that’s a little weird is the syncing of 2 devices. Other than that I really enjoy how interstated Alexa can be. I switched from the google smart home TO Alexa since the new echos aren’t nearly as hit or miss as the the google devices are

Absolutely love!!! I purchased one for every room in my house, from the basement, to the living room and kitchen, all the way up to the bedrooms and outside. I love that I can play “everywhere” and all the speakers play together. It’s like a Sonos but for a fraction of the cost. I can drop in on other rooms to chat. I can make household announcements “dinners ready”.  I can make phone calls without my phone “Alexa call my dad”.  What’s the best part? THE SOUND! Massive improvement over previous models. This is a fantastic sound system!  I love the round look which makes it fun and sleek looking. I’m such a fan! Highly recommend!!

good value for the price, but one annoying feature.  There is a red light ring on the bottom of the unit when the microphone set to 'Off'. It is bright, totally unnecessary and an annoying feature.

I have several generation three echoes, I have a spot and a dot. I have a sub also.  I don’t believe the generation four sounds any better than the generation three. I do however find that the generation four does not listen as well. I don’t know why but it just doesn’t seem to hear a lot of what you say and you have to re-turn lights on and off. Sound quality is no noticeable improvement either. I have no idea why they change the design from the 3 to the 4 I don’t experience any increase in performance. And actually decrease in the microphone.

It seems like years ago the ""announcement"" feature would work as good as it used to. (We use this often in our household to talk to each other.)  We will say announce and it will not hear us sometimes but usually we will say ""Alexa, Announce, The book is on the shelf ready for pickup"" and Alexa will announce ""The book"" or ""The book is"". Also the audio quality is not as good I feel like as even when we do get our full statement across the quality is bad and we cannot hear it.  Maybe the developers are compressing the audio to much???

The product worked very well and I am completely satisfied with the Echo!  I left 4 stars instead of 5 only because while the hub support zwave and zigbee It is limited in terms of the brands it supports.  Zwave under Sylvania for example is not supported and Sylvania is one of the biggest brands out there; however, it does support Sylvania wi-fi bulbs.  So it may not be a great option for those cutting over their zwave and zigbee hubs to Echo, it is a nice start for those who don't mind using wi-fi products.

Every year I wonder what Amazon will come up with next.  I upgraded an old flat dot to this substantially better sounding new version for the den.  The den is.. well a class room, playroom, sorta craft room.  I hooked it up today and was extremely pleased with it's audio output capabilities.  Tomorrow, I'll attempt to connect it to the lil ones' Chromebooks so when they watch educational videos for public school, it's nice and audible.Now I just have to wait on that new beefed-up audio version of the Show coming out soon.  That one will be on my tele-work desk for when I don't want to mess with the HT system.  Keep it up Amazon!

Larger than a softball, this Echo I purchased for the bedroom is quite a bit heftier than the little ""hockey puck"" Dot I have in the kitchen.  I got a charging base so that I can move around into the bathroom and closet with it, but truthfully, the volume and sound quality are such that I think I can leave it in the bedroom most of the time.  I'm quite happy with it so far, even if its size overwhelms the other tchotchkes on the dresser.  Note to Amazon--there are too many models with similar-sounding names and ""generations"", and it doesn't help when you keep selling the old generations at the same time.

I asked it to play some music and it did as asked  Very happy with the sound and function of this unit. I purchased another and added the battery base.

Sound is better than 2nd version.  It includes a room temperature feature, which previously was only available by using a linked Bluetooth thermometer.I’m not crazy about the new “globe” design, and I would never mount it on a wall.  I bought mine as soon as it came out, had I waited for Black Friday/Cyber Monday, I could have saved $30, and gotten 2 free Philips Hue bulbs to boot.  (Not fair!)Also, I wasn’t happy with the white power cord on a Charcoal Echo.  Hopefully, Amazon will sell a replacement cord for this, so it doesn’t look so out of place.

I don’t want my “smart device” to do anything except what I ask.  If I ask it for the current outside temperature, just give me the temperature.  I don’t need a “by the way, I can also help you with ____”.  This terrible feature can’t be turned off and is so frustrating it makes me just not want to use the device as it happens way too often.  Also the sound quality is ok except the bass is way too high.  Even with the bass turned all the way down it’s too much bass!  I feel guilty playing music in my apartment building because I feel like my neighbors can hear it.

I was hoping the sound would have the highs and lows of a premium speaker. Unfortunately, there is plenty of lows with a powerful base sounds but not much on the highs provided by the tweeters.  Also, despite the fact that I have single use music unlimited, it doesn’t recognize consistently provided this unlimited music subscription on the speaker, despite the fact it’s the only speaker in use, I also have a dot and show.l. Overall, if your looking for an Alexa driven speaker with premium sound.  This isn’t the one unless you just are listening the music lows.

I really like the audio sound when playing music but I have noticed when saying your trigger word to trigger the device if there’s other ambient noise going on in a room it will not respond to you, see if the televisions on you need to mute the TV then speak to your device and then it will hear you but if the TVs on you have to speak louder and directly towards it. But other than that it’s a great device and I look forward to using its full potential

First impression: why on earth would Amazon pair a white power cord to a black speaker?? At the very least, give customers a cord color option; for me, my intended placement was a black granite counter btwn my kitchen and family rm, so no opportunity to conceal. Why should I have to pay $20-30 extra for a color-matched cord? Never has been an issue for past Echo devices, of which I have MANY... 14 I thinkSecond: I've grown fond of the cylinder shape, not a fan of this spherical shape; it might make sense if the sound was not front-firing, but sadly is. I could grow accustomed to that if not for the white cord, which Hubby said he could paint, but why should that even need to be a consideration? Besides, my plan was to add a 2nd one as well and, if they failed, alterations would negate the ability to returnLastly: I have 2 charcoal Gen 3 Echos on that same counter; they have black cords, sound really grea! and look great. The last straw was that the sound quality from this 4th Gen was underwhelming; if it was supposed to be a big improvement over the Gen 3s, they definitely missed the mark and it's surely not worth the sacrifices I'd make in appearance. ReturningP.S. To the engineers, please take note! It doesn't matter how much you improve the sound quality - if you also degrade the appearance exponentially it's NOT going in my house. I doubt I'm alone on this...

I traded in my 1st generation Echo for the new 4th generation sphere one, thinking that things would have improved over a couple of years. In two key ways, they have not.1. Mics are less effective.The mics are actually worse at picking up my voice. I find myself repeating the wake word more often, and at a louder volume, just to get the same result. The old cylinder was pretty omni-directional; they new one less so.2. The sound is overly bassy.Yes, you can adjust the bass through the app to tone it down, but you shouldn't have to. I don't have the old and new side by side, so it's hard to judge which sounds better overall, but at least on the default bass setting the new one seems less accurate.What do I like better on the new one? It's shorter, so it doesn't stick out as much on the kitchen island where it lives. You can judge for yourself whether the new esthetic is better, but the design change was not the reason I purchased the new one - I thought the mics and sound would be better, and I'm disappointed.

I wanted a major competitor's version of this, but because that one didn't even offer Bluetooth and was about 230 more...so, after hearing an Echo (I think the one I heard was from earlier 2019..it was tall), I decided to buy one.  Firstly, though the sound is mediocre for its price point, it does not sound as great as the early 2019 one I heard.  This one sounds ok in a large bedroom, but fails miserably in a smaller bedroom (my craft room). There, it, literally, sounds like what it is...a small basic Bluetooth speaker.  Very treble!  I turned it off an connected my iPad back up to the Bluetooth stereo system instead.  I am going to keep it as it does integrate SiriusXM amongst others, but it will remain in the larger bedroom.  Setup was not terribly fun.  My daughter has a dot (those sound worse than this one) and anytime I told Alexa to do something, it went on HER echo...even though we were on opposite ends of the house.  I think this is made more to be used as a system throughout the house versus a more individual toy. I think I got it sorted out now, but there are still issues. It doesn't always respond and it does go out.  I've read it's a WiFi issue, but nothing else goes out when the echo goes out.  My daughter loves hers (she's 16), but she's addicted to music subscription services.  Would I buy it if I had to again?  Probably not.  I'm not too much into this smarthome  technology.  I'm more into sound quality...if the competitor's had Bluetooth, it'd be sitting here instead of the Echo.

Great looking, great sounding improvement over my first generation Echo. Voice recognition and acuity are both outstanding: all it takes is a bit more than a whisper to get Alexa's attention.Sound is very listenable, though a bit bass heavy. The unit tends to throb unless it is put on an extremely rigid surface. But that's just a quibble, as is the unit's tendency to show dust. A lighter gray would have been preferable to the almost black fabric covering.I think I paid $129 or so for my first gen unit. At $100, I consider this an excellent price/performer. I'd certainly consider buying another.

Sound is better than the previous Echo. It’s a bit bigger (wider) than the previous echo. Overall works about the same. Now I have had one issue. My house has some automations that have worked fine with the previous echo, but for some reason, where I would tell Alexa to shut off or turn on from a location within my house is now a shorter distance than the previous echo. It’s like I can’t hear me from the distance I’m at when requesting an action, whereas the previous model did the action From that distance. Maybe I need to tweak or mess with some settings, not sure but it still works and it does sound a lot better!

Don't get fooled by the ""Premium Sound"" designation and pay the extra $$.It's not worth it. The sound is muddy and dull. No real high frequencies and no real bass. It's all just a midrange blur. If you just looking for Echo functionality, save yourself some cash and get the regular version.And the setup is a  bungling mess. It keeps giving me error messages, while at the same time it does obey commands.I also wish it was weather-proof, but that's just a wish...Anyway, I'm not happy. It may have to go back...

I really liked that it came pre-programmed with my info out of the box so set up was minimal.  I was replacing a 2nd generation echo and I immediately noticed the improved quality of the speaker when playing music. The 2nd Gen Echo sounds like an old transistor radio in comparison.  In terms of Alexa, I find myself repeating many commands that were not an issue with with 2nd Gen - particularly with home automation commands. Finally, the white color fits my decor so much better and so much more pleasing to the eye.

So I mainly use mine as an alarm clock and for music. The software used to work seamlessly with my iPhone and PC with my third gen alexa. This one is more janky sometimes annoying to get it to play what I want it too. For alarm purposes works perfectly just kinda upset that I upgraded and got something worse. Plus whit power cable is kinda ugly. It looks and feels cheap.

WOW is all I can say. I don’t know if the bass is resonating through my dresser or what... but it sounds pretty great! Out of the box the sound is good, but a bit flat. Go into the app, turn up the bass, mid or treble to your liking and BAM! Love this thing. I had thought about the Echo Studio but did NOT want something that size and price. So glad I got this instead. With the sound they produce, I’d happily take 4 of these all around the house than 1 large one located in just 1 room. Thanks Amazon! Great upgrade from the basic Dots.

I had a 1st generation Echo and this one is leaps and bounds better than what I had. The sound is better and the microphone picks things up better as well. But an Echo is only as good as you let it be, so make sure you know what you can do with it and use it to its fullest potential.

With so many reviews everything has been said, but I will repeat. The sound is excellent...amazing even. I was going to pair it with my BT speaker but there is no need, this does a nice job with music. Other reviewers are right about  sensitivity, though. This Gen 4 just does not seem to hear me as well as my previous Echo or Echo Dots. Still, if I am next to it, it hears me fine. I wanted the Zigbee hub, but why couldn't Amazon add a ZWAVE hub in addition; that would make for great Echo.

I got interested in this based upon its Zigbee hub capability.  I had two lights whose parent hub no longer worked with Alexa, when I read about the 4th gen being also a hub, I bought it.Upon receipt I was controlling my lights inside 20 minutes.  Replaced my older dot in the kitchen and threw out the old hub!

Our All-new Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa is amazing! The sound, including the bass, is beautiful and clear. It permeates through our home. We couldn't be happier!NOTE: I noticed many poor reviews on the 4th Generation compared to the 3rd Generation. Unfortunately, these folks must have purchased the basic 4th Generation model NOT this model. I presume they did not read the information provided by Amazzon on each 4th Generation model. If I were Amazon, I would have made a noticeable distinction between the 4th Generation models. This might have eliminated the number of the basic 4th Generation Echo Dots that are going to be returned.

Its wonderful to have a new hub we can zone to one area (our basement) with other speakers (new gen dot). The sound is amazing but the volume could use a boost. Integrates well into our our smart home. Only downfall is that from what we have seen, you cannot stream music on two different zones (groups) without the Amazon Unlimited Music option. Hoping we can figure it out because I need my main floor and basement groups to play different music.

Traded in a first generation Echo on this model.  Voice recognition is better but not perfect.  Amazon is still well behind the curve when it comes to Alexa having access to general knowledge or knowing enough American slang.  It sounds like a trivial matter until you use these devices every day and realize its not.Sound has improved greatly since the first generation.  It's actually quite amazing quality coming from something so small.Did purchase the Samuel L Jackson voice package.  It's amusing but does not increase the overall usability of the device.

I used the Amazon Tech support to get set up because I kept having problems. Multiple Alexa answering simultaneously with different information. Still have problems with the speakers not being in sync and duplicity. Have had to un-sync and delete to then add them back to my groups. Apart from that, I am so happy to have music and be able to play any song/album I can think of with my Amazon Music Unlimited. The Echo speakers themselves sound really, really good. Bought on Prime day for $40 off made it a great deal.

Really enjoying the speaker; adding the ""made for amazon"" battery base by mission really adds versatility to the speaker.  We labeled it as the ""echo floater"" and placed it into a catch all room called ""home"" (the home room is for smarthome/IoT devices that don't necessarily have a specific room within our household). We use this speaker in our side parlor, kitchen, front porch and to the back patio. On travels, we plan to use it our airstream.Sound quality is full and works well for our needs though our Sonos one units do sound better, but with Echo features and overall sound you get more for money with this new Echo 4.

My old Echo Dot second generation had a clearer sound and better voice recognition than this model. I thought it would improve with some equalizer tweaks but it was just okay and only stays for a minute.Voice recognition only is successful if I am standing within 5-6 feet or if I yell.I need to see if I can get my old one back or new model or I don’t know. I’m sure Amazon will help me figure this out.

The Echo has been a pleasant surprise so far.Its be able to help me find my phone, select my favorite music and news programs at night. I can lower or increase the volume without getting out the bed. The sound is good depending on what room it is in. I have no problem recommending this product.
","Positive"
"
I'll start this by saying that the sound is amazing. It's a rich, bass filled sound that can fill a large garage.I didn't expect this to be so big and this is why I've removed a star. I probably should have read the specs. Being so large, I wish more lighting options were built in. The light ring might work on the regular dot, but paired with the wall mount, it's kinda hard to see if Alexa woke up. Clock would have been nice to have too.

My only thoughts were... who dropped the ball on the white power cord. But it isn’t the end of the world. Especially since there is a white wall the cord is dangling next to lolAfter reading the reviews I was a little bit worried about voice recognition and sound quality but I thought it sounded really good and it did recognize my voice very easily.The set up was beyond incredibly easy. I plugged it in... opened Alexa app tapped ok on set up and it was ready to go. It may have taken like 30 seconds or less.It was bigger than I was expecting which is great and I think it looks pretty cool!

This came early and made it for Christmas Day which was awesome! I have 1 tower and 5 small dots. This was for my bedroom instead of the small dot. It was easy to add to my Amazon app and setup. I immediately played some music on it and I'm truly impressed! Even at volume 30 you could feel the bass. The thing that shocked me the most was it's size! I thought this was just a round version of the small dots from the pictures shown. It is not! This thing is too big to hold in one hand and heavy. Great craftsmanship, I'm extremely happy with my preorder purchase and it was well worth the wait!

My beef with this product is as follows:1) despite multiple people requesting it, Amazon refuses to create the ability to turn off Alexa saying “Now connected to [your name]’s” iPhone whenever you connect a device2) Alexa will randomly say something to you even though you didn’t give her a command. Super creepy that it’s always listening + has so many issues with thinking you gave her a command

This is a stylish unit, but that may be the cause for concern.  I have all the generations of Echo units in operation currently, and this one really comes up short on voice recognition.  The older units can be triggered from 20+ feet away, which is really helpful when turning on lights, for example, as you are entering a dark room.  This unit has trouble beyond 5 feet.Sound quality is on par with the 3rd gen unit.The light ring at the bottom is also not optimal, as it is not as easily noticed from a distance.I truly believe this generation was an effort in value engineering.  It just feels ""Cheaper"" that it's older sibling.  Part of this is the removal of the volume adjustment via the top ring.One more note, the control buttons are right on the fabric, so grimy hands will stain the speaker mesh over time.  This unit also needs to be dusted with a vacuum or canned air, as it cannot be wiped off on top due to the fabric cover.

I love having the Echo and echo dots in multiple rooms and being able to control all three. I wish however that it allowed for guest account sharing so if friends are visiting or anyone else in our household wants to play their own music on them, they could do so without messing up my music profile. Very annoying but not a deal breaker, just means I have all of the control ;) That is the only reason the overall rating is not 5 stars. Also the echo speakers systems is superior to the echo dots.

This made my old stereo system obsolete. I always thought the bigger the speaker the better the sound quality. This blows that way of thinking out the water. The bass is unbelievable seeing how small this thing is. With a free subscription of Amazon Music all I have to do is say what I want to hear and it plays it. I also connected it to my desktop and cell phone where I have music downloaded that I can play through Alexa as the speaker. Great buy.

I opted to buy and pair two Echos. I have them mounted about 20 feet apart at 31/2 feet off the floor and about four from the nearest walls of my 1000 square foot open plan ground floor. As I walk from the kitchen through the family area and into the living room the stereo effect is true and balanced. I subscribe to Amazon music, so my music selection is endless. When I want to listen to music in German, Amazon music allows me to make selections on my android and play those albums on my Echos.

I was initally worried about my purchase after seeing the mixed reviews about the sound quality, voice recognition, and white cable. But now that I've had time with the echo, I can say it is well worth the money. The sound quality is similar to the Bose soundlink mini which has been my favorite portable speaker for years. I have had no issues with Alexa hearing my voice even with loud music playing. Yes it does come with a white cable, but it doesn't matter to me because it is hidden where I have it placed. I don't like echo dots because the sound is not nearly as good. If you're looking for an echo, this is the one to get.

I like to fall asleep to the TV. There is a commercial with the dude dancing on a coffee table for the special sound technology. While I'm dead asleep Alexa wakes up and loudly starts playing the latest music selection they are promoting. Alexa reacts to and acts on the BS commercials that promote anything that has alexa integration. WTF ALEXA?!!!!!. What is the point of voice recognition if it is going to act on anything happening on TV. My Echo is starting to get on my nerves....

I bought this specifically to get a certain radio station in our living room as the 1990s receiver no longer works for radio. This was far cheaper than replacing the receiver. It frequently misunderstands my commands. It knows my voice, but does really weird things instead of what I want. It isn't terrible, but it is just okay. I can get my radio station. I have used it for some reminders. I suppose it is learning and I am also.

The device is good.  Software implementation seems problematic.Strange behavior from an Echo 8 device when a simple command like ""Alexa Play XXXX (radio station call sign).  Used to work well and never paid much attention to it.  Then Alexa said some like ""Getting XXXX from iHeart radio"" followed by silence.  After several hours it started working again.  I notice that an Echo 8 device is displaying temperature and date on the screen saver page.  Like the Echo 5 has since delivery.  It seems that Echo firmware updates were pushed out.

I am a older bachelor, and Amazon put a female voice in my house.  This is what made me a loyal Amazon customer for life.  I actually find the voice recognition to be better then the Gen 1, especially with music playing.  The sound quality is better than all but the highest quality Bluetooth speakers, and nothing at the price point comes close..  I'll probably buy 10 more Echos before I die, and they will get better with every generation. Thank you Alexa for always being there for me, your services are greatly appreciated.

I have this Alexa device in my room and I keep the first version in my restroom. Let me tell you that the quality of sound is good but every time I call for ‘Alexa’ it doesn’t listen. And it can be next to me and it won’t listen to my commands. The 1st generation Mini echo can listen to me and I don’t have to be repeating myself, cost me $15 3 years ago and it still is better quality than this brand new one, it’s disappointing.

Don’t pay $99 for this speaker you can find this for $60 at many retailer’s. It is better than the previous version but not by much. The design is nice like a ball 👍 unfortunately two weeks after I got this I picked up the Belkin SOUNDFORM™ elite Alexa speaker so unfortunately this one was retired to the garage lol. My recommendation for the next generation of Alexa would be to have a charging dock or cradle to the next design or at least a USB out. My recommendation🙏

This was my fifth Alexa Echo products that I've purchased. I don't know what it is about the new design, but now it seems to never hear me say the wake up word. I feel like I have to shout Alexa just to get her to light up, so I know she's listening. I'm also super frustrated that podcast can't be fast-forwarded to specific time within the podcast. I use this feature all the time when Alexa plays an audible book, so why can't it be used for podcast as well? I also feel like this most recent iteration of the echo doesn't understand what I'm asking, even though I can  use a similar phrase for my studio Echo and I'll be understood. I tried to buy an adapter to put it on the wall cuz I hate how much space it takes on surfaces, and of course I ended up with a dot wall adapter for the echo instead of this size. I just wish they would call it a different name or a different induration or something to make it identifiable without me having to feel like an expert at the dimensions of each of the objects. I found it really irritating that the cord for the power had been shortened almost a foot, and I couldn't put this new echo in the same location as my old Echo because they switch the power integration port to an AUX port instead of whatever it was before. I still love my studio Echo, but overall I'm super disappointed in this product.

I bought the package with that included the Phillips Hue bulbs. Everything connected easily and I love letting Alexa turn the lights on and off. I was able to preset the lights to turn on at a specific time so there is no delay in having a lit house. I really like it.

Okay, this is almost the Echo I've been waiting for. I haven't had a chance to explore it fully yet, because when I got it all set up played some of my favorite music on it, I dropped everything to rush over and offer up a review of that alone. I've always used my Echo mostly for practical matters, playing music on other speakers. Now, while it's still not the best speaker I own yet, I probably won't switch over from my Echo out of frustration anymore. I didn't buy it just to be a speaker, but I always hoped it would become a better one. It has just become a MUCH better one. Bravo, Echo!

I was hesitant about purchasing this latest version of Echo, since my older ones still work perfectly, but WOW!! I’m SO glad I did! The sound quality on this is amazing and it plays so much louder then my 2nd gen one.

I bought a Google Nest Hub Max at the same time, and noticed the following:Sound quality: The Echo has better sound quality.Voice recognition: Google Nest Hub Max voice recognition is far superior, I often have to shout for the Echo to acknowledge my voice, even at short distances.Usability: Google Nest Hub Max is sooo much easier to use since it doesn't have all the regional restrictions that the Echo has, I can't even download the Alexa app in HK and had to use a VPN. Then even with the app set up, most of the skills don't work on the Echo with no explanation given, including flash briefings (I can only get the weather on the Echo, but can get the full list when using the Alexa app). Tech support was completely unhelpful. And even if I set Spotify as the default music provider, it almost always plays music from Amazon Music instead.I guess users in the US may have a better experience, but due to compatibility issues here in HK I can just about use it for playing music. Conclusion: Just buy the Google Nest to save yourself some grief.

It’s a great speaker especially for the discounted price. My only issue is more so with the Alexa ecosystem where I can’t use a group of Alexa speakers as a group Bluetooth speaker which I was kind of hoping for (yes, you can use the group for music, but can’t use it for unsupported apps/sites e.g playing YouTube audio in group). Aside from that it’s been an okay experience, I’m sure as more people use the echos the ecosystem will get better and gain more features, but I was hoping to be able to group up different speakers and get a lot more from them.

I think the sound quality is excellent on this new Echo. Had to adjust the bass a bit, easily done in the app. It sits on a wood dresser and that seems to make the bass deeper. I am hearing better high and midtones, too, in comparison to a good quality bluetooth speaker and dot. Voice recognition is better than a dot but still has breaks. It is a challenge in my house with multiple barking dogs...I'm disabled and find Echo and devices very helpful all over the house.

I was excited about this new Echo.  I was especially excited to be able to trade in my old model to this new one.  The sound is great BUT it doesn't recognize my husbands voice AT ALL.  Also we had a routine and I tried to recreate it for the new one.  It won't recognize the routine.  It took me 2 hours to figure out how to set up a routine.  I tried to get support but it continues to get me to on-line stuff and you cannot talk to anyone.  I wish I had never upgraded.  If I could go back I would.UPDATE:An amazon representative called me and the young man was so very nice.  He helped me resolve the issues above quite easily. Sent a long detailed email on what to do.  I now will say that I would purchase again.  I upgraded the review to a 3 and switched between a 3 & a 4 but settled on a 3 because it was a struggle to get to this point.  I would Recommend this dot.Thanks Sarah

The microphone on this fourth generation echo device it’s not nearly as sensitive as the previous versions. My 2nd Gen Echo device will respond from almost twice the distance while trying to activate the 4th Gen.

Did they not test this product before mass production?? The sound is just overkill bass even when turn down bass in settings.  Have to repeat yourself several where maybe she will hear you then it's another thing of she hears you correctly. Very very disappointed. They majorly dropped the ball on this. The previous models were way better than this one as far as function and sound. Shame on the designers on this and on the people that approved this model. Buy gen 3 or wait and hope they do waaaaay better on gen 5. Which they should send out free to all the people that wasted their hard earned money on this model.

Received this as a gift.  It's really neat.  Easy to set up and voice recognition is good.  Alexa does what she is supposed to do.  However, I was a little disappointed in the music sound quality.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I reverted back to another brand of standalone speaker for music for now.  Volume adjustment appears limited to incremental steps.  Sound seems better in a smaller room.  Overall, pleased with the fun stuff Alexa does.

I purchased because of the smart hub feature. I assume it would be slightly larger then their dot model but upon arrival I noticed immediately the box was pretty heavy.  It was bigger then expected which was not a big deal to me, just a surprise.I started play some music and the sound was stunning. Upon hearing it I moved it from the room I intended to use it in and moved into my kitchen so I could take advantage of the great sound. I’m going to pick up another one for my bathroom next.

While the shape is nice, I think the cylindrical shape of my Echo 2 is better. Even though I have the same settings on both devices, I find that sometimes the Echo 4 does not do what I want. Simple example: my Echo 2 will take multiple instructions without having to repeat the wake word, but the Echo 4 will not.  But it does what I want, so that's a minor thing. I only use the device to turn on/off items and occasionally ask for a bit of information, so I don't know how well it works as a speaker.

Needed to replace an original generation Echo.  Great Prime Day price.  Really good sound for the price.  Minus one star for shipping with a white power cord for my black Echo.  Pretty lame.

It sounds great. The bass sounds a bit better than the 3rd Gen. It is also a bit more clear. The main downside and it is huge and honestly I cannot even believe Amazon came to this horrible conclusion is that the light is on the bottom. So I barely have an object in front of it I call out to alexa and I have no clue if she heard me because of the hidden light. I am sure there will be many similar complaints. Over all it was a good speaker and I am happy with it

The sound quality is rather good. The bass is heavy, which is good for some music, but not videos. I do feel that I have to yell the command name for it to hear me. This is odd as my first gen echo dot will hear me whisper it's name. I have tested them in the same spot and this device does not recognize as well as previous models. It does not tether to older alexas ( not a minus just extra information). Another thing I have noticed, is that when bluetooth paired with a fire stick; apps like hulu and Netflix seem to crash.This was bought for me as a gift and the pictures are somewhat misleading as they do not show a cord in many of them. This lead to the belief that it had an internal battery that allowed it to be moved between rooms. (Which would have been a great selling point). This device does not have an internal battery. In fact the charge cable it comes with is short, so keep that in mind when thinking about where you wish to place it. I have a first gen alexa and the cable that came with it is longer.A note for Amazon, when this device was first advertised, it showd a globe pattern. When I saw that, I wanted this device. I was disappointed that there was no actual globe/map print available. I feel that whoever designed that add had a great idea that was never produced into reality. To add on, it would have been nice to have the clock face added to this as well.

I love this Echo, but it doesn't always work. Sometimes, it simply does not seem to hear my voice, even when I stand right over it and speak loudly. I called customer service and they suggested unplugging it, waiting a bit, then plugging it back in. That did work for a few days, but then I had to do that again. I'm still trying to decide about whether to ask for an exchange. It should just work all the time, every day, all day long.

Radio reception where I live is not so good, particularly for classical music stations (I guess there is a law requiring them to have low power compared to rock stations). But with the Echo, I can sit outside and listen to the radio over the internet. So good WiFi sensitivity. Even better, I can interrupt to music to ask Alexa to play something from the Amazon world, or for anything else I might want. It would be even better if it was waterproof, but that may be asking too much for the price and sound quality.

I have had Echos since the original beta group back in 2014. I still have and use my Gen 1 every day. I currently have 9 of them including Echo Autos, 4 dots, and an Echo Flex. I purchased this 4th gen to replace the 1st gen that I use as the main Echo in my living room. The 1st gen is still working great, but it's not compatible with some of the new Alexa features.We got it last year on black Friday. It would respond to commands OK for a few hours. After that, it would stop responding entirely. You could manually wake it with the button, but it would not hear you at all. A power reset would fix it, for a few hours or a day and then it would happen all over again. After dealing with Amazon, they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same issue. Even when it did work, you had to speak very loud and close. The Echo dots on the other side of the house would respond instead of this one 3 feet away.The Echo was placed in the same location as the one it replaced, on the same network.After going through 2 units, we figured there was some sort of known issue. We returned the second unit and went back to our 1st gen. A year later (hoping that the issues have been worked out), we purchased another unit. Guess what? New unit has the same exact issue.Search Google for Echo 4th gen microphone issues and you will see this happens to a lot of people. Even when they do worth, they don't work nearly as good as previous generations. Which is a shame.For now, this one is going back again and we will continue to use our 1st gen until Amazon can get it together.

I purchased one of the original  alexa echos many years ago.  Lately alexa got slower and slower and many times did not recognize my voice commands.  I upgraded my internet provider but it had little effect on alexa.  I decided to purchase a new 3rd gen model.  What a difference.  Voice recognition is by far superior now than my original one.  I can ask alexa to add something to my shopping list from rooms away and she hears what I said and responds immediately. I am totally pleased with my purchase.

First off, I’m still a bit upset my first Echo plus ironically went out a couple weeks after the warranty expired. I am not a fan of the bigger footprint and round ball design. I liked the cylindrical design way better as it had a smaller footprint. The ugly white cord is way too short so you’ll probably need an extension cord depending on if and where your going to mount it. As other reviewers say, it does have a problem hearing it’s “wake up” name here and there but not often enough to annoy us yet. The sound is a bit better than my old unit but we don’t use it for music. Overall its ok, if you need a hub it’s probably the cheapest way to go.

I tried to install the Phillips Hue bulbs using the Phillips Hue app (the app with BT and w/o BT). It would not find the bulbs or the Echo's hub.  Its supposed to work, because the Echo 4th gen is Zigbee compatible like the Hue bulbs need.So with some great help from Amazon tech support reps, I learned I could use the Amazon Alexa app and add the bulbs and many other devices via the Alexa app vice the OEM app. Much easier, and worked EVERY TIME.So, I am a happy inside-camper.  Thank you Amazon tech support.  Much appreciated.

I really love the good bass sound from this device. Alexa is great. Added Amazon Music Unlimited so music listening is great. Also love the ability to receive calls from other Echo users or people using their mobile phones, and likewise to call other Echo devices and mobile phones. The major drawback with this product is that the music volumes aren't normalized between songs. The volume can drastically change between songs. This is a major flaw.  It isn't a good music listening experience.

Love the new Echo!  It has great sound and I love the look of it.  I am giving four stars because I purchased a black unit and, like other reviewers, I got a white cord.  I don’t like it.  Should be a black cord.  I was hoping that the cord from the older Echo would work, but it doesn’t.  The cord from a Dot also doesn’t fit.  Too bad Amazon doesn’t make the cables universal - like Apple does - regardless which Echo you use.  Something Amazon should consider.

I asked my wife for this Echo with premium sound for Christmas last year. In the 50 weeks it has been connected it has only been used to play music a few time. The sound quality is poor for something that tauts itself as premium sound. I just noticed that they have a ""studio"" version for $199 which is about $20 more than a portable Bose speaker with Google. My wife has a portable Bose speaker (no Google) and the sound quality is incredible.I think it may be time to switch to Bose / Google.

All of the 4th Gen Echos are Amazon's greatest failure. The 3rd Gens are great, they hear you every time. they stay connected to the internet, they do what they're made to do every singe time.--The 4th Gens do the exact opposite, from day one all of the 4th Gen ones I have purchased have done nothing but fail to do what they are made to do. They have better speakers, and this big one has added a temperature sensor, which is truly a game changer for routines, allowing Alexa to monitor the temperature of a room and adjust accordingly on her own. Howver she NEVER hears me say her name the first time, 80% of the time once she does, she will not hear the command I give her. How is an Echo supposed to work if it cannot understand its user. That is literally the ONLY thing these things need to do--well that and stay connected to the internet. there is a 50/50 shot that when I say her name, she gives me the ""the intertnet isnt accessible"" line. When it Very much is. every other device I have connects and stays connected just fine. It is only the 4th Gen echos that have so much trouble staying connected.  The temperature sensor is the only real thing worth even trying to buy one of these, but its hugely unreliable at best, and sadly no other temperature sensor can initiate a routine based on the rooms degree yet. -----Do not waste your money on the 4th gen, buy a 3rd gen or wait for the 5thand Amazon, do NOT call me this time. The last time I left a negative review on an echo device (the 4th gen dot) you called me. --I appreciate the gesture, amazing customer support, one of the reasons I love amazon. but this is not a user error, I do IT for a living, this is not failure to set up properly, this is device malfunction.

The first one was a gift, I love the product so much I bought two more.  The negative thing is that my computer guy spent close to an hour trying to set them up where they would all play at the same time the same tune.  I got notification that could be done.  After close to an hour of working with this, we finally gave up so, I can have them playing all the same tune at the same time like Sono.  Other than that disappointment I love them.

I've had an Echo Dot (3rd gen) in our living room for a couple of years and while the sound quality wasn't bad, it struggle being in a larger room.  The only way to improve the sound was to crank up the volume (louder isn't better).  The new Echo's sound quality is vastly improved over the Dot and is able to fill the room without needing to increase the volume.  The Dot is now in my master bedroom and is a much better fit for that space.  The new Echo's interface continues to be excellent and the new look is also nice.  I would recommend the Echo without reservation.

Now the thing is not playing right. I got it 9 months ago. Maybe the gen 3s where working to good so they made it to break down. I am going to prob buy a google one and give this one away.

I'm not one of those reviewers who has a bit of Alexa devices in their home as well as a bit of Google Assistant.

Throughout my home I now own:Echo (4th generation)2 Echo Dots (both 3rd gen)Echo Show 8Echo Show 53 Echo FlexFire 8 HD PlusEcho Input (I wish I knew just how phenomenal of a deal these were when I purchased this one, id have 9 of these in my house and 1 device with visual output).Always having the appropriate expectations (ie never expected ie Echo flex to sound like a bose speaker) i have never once been even slightly disappointed with any of the products listed above....until this Echo (4th generation). I prefer the round design and I like to have the latest and greatest, that's all it is, sad but true. I never expected any of these products to actually regress though as their technology allegedly has improved continously. Id say after owning for a month or so im sitting at about a 70% hit rate when it comes to this advice recognizing it's name and and switching into a phase waiting for a command. Not sure what it is either, I've walked right up to and practically yelled ""ALEXA"" (and while I was frustrated I was sure to very clear spoken words) and yet it still didn't respond.I'm really hoping this is a software fix they can push out or I wouldn't hesitate to take this down to 1 star.

No thanks, I will just return itUpdate:  After my previous review, a rep from Amazon contacted me and was very helpful.  He was able to push an update through that fixed my echo and made it much more responsive.2nd Update:  After using the updated echo for a few days it was not more responsive.

We all already know that the entire line of Echo/Alexa products is awesome so I won't rehash all that information.  What I will say is that this new Echo device sounds incredible.  I upgraded my original Echo device, which sounded great, to this Gen-4 device and it's worth every penny for the sounds improvement alone.  Of course, all the other features work as well, or better, on this new device.  Although I have read other reviews questioning the new spherical design but my household thinks the new design looks cool and appears to blend in better than the old ""oatmeal can"" design.

This was such a good buy overall. I had been contemplating for some time if I should purchase. As soon as I saw it available on special on prime day I jumped on it. Delivery was super quick. Item was delivered complete and undamaged. Its very convenient for everything. Provides the daily News, weather, time, shopping list and much more. I ended up buying 3 more for other rooms. The only thing that I my husband has an issue with is that it does not have enough bass for his liking.

This was a gift. Set up was fairly easy. This could be a very useful tool-unfortunately, it does not integrate with my TCL Smart TV although it is supposed to. In fact, it doesn’t help with any of my electronic or electrical devices, lights, etc because mine are “standard” and not “Alexa-type”. So unless I invest quite a bit of money and alter what’s in place- This Echo is very restrictive in what it can do for me.

SHE WILL NOT SHUT UP! She has to  randomly scream and remind me what she is connected to. Why why why! This is when on silent mode. Sound is good and has more features Thant google mini but my mini is easier to use, better voice recognition, AND it keeps its mouth shut unless I want it to talk. Countless complaints about this and Amazon does nothing. Sound and deign are much nicer though. Too bad it doesn’t matter when I want to toss out my window

Other people were correct, it does come off deaf.  I'll wake Alexa up, tell it to do something, and nadda.  Have to repeat myself.  But sometimes it replies OK, but doesn't do the thing I asked so I have to repeat myself again.The sound quality is decent, and the foot print allows you to sock it wherever....

Pros-Sound quality is good for a small size.Build seems good also.Cons-Wifi coverage for any Echo device is poor.Keeping a constant connection is poor.Having multiple devices in a room makes it difficult for voice recognition,  unless your speaking right in front of the device.If you lose power some devices cannot reconnect. Some actually just won't connect properly anymore, no matter what you do.So far out of the 8 devices I have, I have had to return 2 for connection issues.

I recently bought a Muse headband with an app that I connect to my Amazon Echo. When the headband detects I've woken up in the middle of the night, it connects to BT and starts play sleep sounds to get me back to sleep. Unfortunately, every time the Echo connects to BT it announces very loudly ""Connected to iPhone!"" which startles me. I've done research and there have been complaints since 2016 of this but Amazon is not listening to their customers. There is no way to change it. Even if announcements are set to off and brief mode is on.Unfortunately, that meant I have to return and get a Google Nest Audio, which meant if I really want to use the Muse headband I have to switch my smart home to Google. All I can say is if you want some peace with the BT feature on a smart speaker, get the Google Nest Audio. It's much better. It will play a soft connection sound. It's a hassle changing everything but makes a world of difference, and I am now happy overall with a company that pays attention to its customers.

I was pleased with unit when received. Sound was good. There was a little more base than I wanted in relationship to treble and how pleasantly surprised I was to see on app I could adjust bass, midrange and treble levels to get it just the way I want. All future ones will be this model with premium sound in locations where I plan to listen to music. Also, the fact they pleaded to my account so when I plugged it in it found the WiFi and logged on itself using password from account so there really was no setup and I was listening to music.

I bought this to replace my 3rd gen echo dot for improved sound quality.  The sound is better than the dot it replaced so I'm pretty happy with that aspect.  Compared to both the 3rd and 4th gen echo dots I own, the microphone does not seem to work as well.  I never had as much trouble with the 3rd gen that this replaced in exactly the same spot and conditions.It also refuses to change the volume about 50% of the time by voice command.  Every other night I have to change volume by hand or in the app because it just won't. I wouldn't buy this again from the frustration with the failed volume control and poor mic.  Eventually I'll get fed up enough to replace it and it probably won't be with an Amazon product.

I replaced mt 1st generation Alexa with this and am glad I did.  Great voice recognition and easily linked to my Kasa wall switches. The sound is much better on this unit as well.

This Echo is definitely stereo quality and no hiccups while playing music.  If you have an earlier version of Alexa, it’s time to upgrade, you won’t be sorry.

I recently traded in all my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen devices to ""upgrade"" to the 4th gen devices.  If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well.  We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor.  Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding.  The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.2) The sound is awful.  The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base.  The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny.  If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it.  Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services.  If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request.  100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times.  Overall, the Echo has gone from a fun device that was worth the potential privacy concerns to an annoying banner ad that you can't click to close.  The current user experience makes me just want to throw these things in the trash and I own 4 of them.

The new Alexa is cumbersome to move around. You really can't hold it comfortably in one hand. The sound is somewhat improved , the quality of the sound is often the quality of the location the sound is heard in. I listen in my home or on the deck. So to compare it to the old one is tough. I can notice the bass a little more. The sound quality of the old Alexa was very good. Moving Alexa from point A to point B is a pain. Certainly there was a need to tweak the old Alexa. But to completely reconfigure/redesign the whole thing then require a base attachment for portability is perplexing. I love my Alexa and the music she brings into my life. It's too bad it's gotten more cumbersome for me to enjoy my music.

We upgraded from 2nd generation to 4th generation Alexa.

After a slight repositioning in the bookcase, the problem was solved.The aesthetics of the new Alexa was a welcome improvement and the sound quality outstanding. We use it primarily for streaming music in the living room. Another good feature, the older Alexa is now located in the office. No reason to disgard it.

Have had all the Alexa's but the super expensive pro models and these are by far the best sounding ones yet! I bought 2 and paired with my Alexa subwoofer and FireStick 4k for my home theater and it blows old echo dots out of water. Thunderous bass and crisp sound that was way better sounding then my LG sound bar. Highly recommend adding the sub and buying 2 of these. Although these aren't the cheapest echo's I was glad I bought the higher up versions and not the cheaper $30 range ones.

There is no remote pairing available. Five stars so my review sees the light of day as one star reviews are summarily buried. I can’t believe that Amazon dropped the ball on this one. Without a remote you’re left to yell at the echo or use your phone app. I may return this if using the phone app as a remote frustrates me. I expect this kind of decision from Apple, but Amazon? This is common sense - a remote is needed to fully enjoy. Thankfully I have my first gen that works with the remote to fall back on. Wow, just wow.

I have this set up in a 3 speaker group....Echo Show 5, this , and a regular dot.  The sound from this Echo Dot is very good for the size of it.  The Echo Show 5 seems almost as loud, but just not as much bass.  This thing has a lot of bass, and when the group plays together, it sounds really good.  I gave it 5 stars, because it was on sale, and I think I paid $69 for it.  I would not pay $99, it isn't good enough to pay that much, but at $69, it is totally worth it.

I got this to replace an original Echo which needed a speaker to really be effective. At first I ordered the smaller Echo, but after listening to a sound comparison between this unit and the smaller one, I cancelled the smaller and ordered this one. I like that it has the hub for smart bulbs built in (so I can use my smart plug elsewhere) and the sound is excellent! It also responds to my voice without yelling, which I had to do with my old Echo. Its definitely worth the extra money if you want to play music, like I do. This is my fourth Echo!

The one problem I’ve had with it, is that sometimes when I askAlexa to play something it sounds muffled and “underwater”.

Overall, I'm very pleased with it. I bought it primarily to have a good sounding device for streaming music without having to connect to my Bose Wave radio via bluetooth. The sound is quite good and gives me more options for controlling the bass volume than I have with the Bose Wave. It seems a little more ""picky"" than the two Echo dot devices I own. I've had to unplug it to reset it a few times -- something I almost never have to do with the older dot devices.

We have had the Echo dot for probably 3 or 4 years.  Finally decided to upgrade to the Echo (4th generation) and it is a much bigger improvement than expected.

It was super easy to setup and we just moved the dot to one of the bedrooms.

I gave this to my son for his 21st birthday. We've found the sound quality to be quite good. He was able to replace a bulky, obnoxious old sound system that took up the whole top of his dresser with this Echo.The only issue I've noticed is Alexa's voice recognition. Sometimes, you have to use a loud, slow voice when speaking. I suppose that's true of all Echo products, though.I must say: Being able to control the volume of this Echo from the Alexa app on my phone is a life saver.

Out of the box... WAY TOO MUCH BASS! Echo's speaker equalizer settings (LOW-bass/MID-range/HIGH-tweeter) are TOO important to bury inside Alexa app! They should have their own buttons on top of the orb next to volume settings. For now, put Equalizer button prominently next to volume button in per device controls in app! On next update, provide some presets like Hip-Hop, Country, Pop, Rock, Talk, etc. ""Alexa... Preset ROCK... Play The Eagles on Pandora!"" ... ""Alexa... Preset RAP... Play Eminem on Spotify!""

The only reason that I gave 2 stars is because the sound quality is great. That's where the fun stops.This device is so glitchy that I want to throw it out the window most days. For example, my morning alarm just went off; I'm laying 3 feet from 4th Gen Echo Dot; I ask it to stop the the alarm; from the living room, 30 feet away, I hear ""Morning Alarm stopped on bedroom"". Whyyyyyyy?When I ask Alexa to play music while I'm in the living room, she will respond from the proper device ""what would you like to listen to?"", but then she will start playing the music on the Echo Dot in my bedroom. When I tell her she is playing on the wrong device she'll respond ""I'm sorry, I don't recognize a device by that name"". When I ask her to stop playing the music it she won't, because she's does not recognize I'm talking about the bedroom unit. When I ask her to stop playing music in the Bedroom, she doesn't understand. When I ask her to play music, again, she says ""Amazon Music is currently streaming on another device"". Ugh. How far do think I can throw this thing?Hey Bezos, when you get back from douching around in outer space can you please hire someone to update your Echo Integration System. Thx.

If you are fully ingrained in the Amazon eco system, then maybe you'll enjoy this product, but you'd be better off just buying a higher quality Bluetooth speaker (that's portable) for the same price.It was given to me as a present and has been nothing but a pain. First it wouldn't activate, support said it had been returned and that I needed to purchase it in order to get it to work. After some annoying back and forth followed by me calling it quits and asking to return it, they finally activated it so I wouldn't hurt their bottom line. Added sportify, started playing some music, and was meh about it. They replace quality sound with an obnoxiously plastic sounding big thumping bass that drowns out the mids and highs even when turned all the way down.Went to use the speaker for a second time, and it will no longer connect to my Spotify, but will still play music/audio books through any of Amazon's services(hmmmm.....). Did all of the troubleshooting steps recommended by support, and still no luck.Not worth the money or hassle.

I got this because another review said the Dot didn't have that great of sound. I had a dot and decided to upgrade. One, the dot didn't have as bad a sound as the review but I use the are to listen to music a lot and felt a little better would be worth it. It was. Not a huge difference, but to the positive. The feature of timers and lists I use a lot and ask questions I would normally look up. It is great fun.

Ordered a pair of red ones for a stereo pair.  Named one echo, so they could coexist in the same room.  The sound for the size is amazing.  Classical, to jazz, to rock has very clear highs, good low end, and great midrange, with very little adjustment. The only complaint I've got, (probably my fault for having multiple echo devices is sometimes, right next to the unit being spoken to, one of the other echos think you are talking to it.  Talk to the one in the living room, and the show in the kitchen answers. Not a huge deal, best be aware.

This Echo is easy to set up and works well. I am only using it for basic functions like setting timers and reminders and also for playing music. So far the voice recognition has been good with only a few misunderstandings. I have it controlling some lights in the house and it is synced with a Ring doorbell which works well and was easy to set up. The sound quality is good, but I have other single speakers that have better sound quality in my opinion.

I really like Amazon products, especially the Echo devices.  I have several Echo devices. All my echo devices that are black came with a black cord/plug.  I received the new Echo (4 Gen).  I opened the box and removed the black echo.  I removed the cord/plug from the box and its white!  Really Amazon????  I mean come on!!!  I have this Black Echo on a black table and right away you notice this white cord coming out of the back of the Echo. REALLY!!!!?????  Very disappointed with Amazon.

The sound quality is pretty good for such a little thing.  I was a little concerned about being able to set it up completely independent of another Echo we have in the house.  We had to futz with it a little.  Amazon wants to connect all the devices by default.  In particular, we wanted different wake words for each device.  The online setup wouldn't make the change for just one of the Echo devices but then my son just said, ""Alexa, change wake word to Amazon"" - and presto, changed for one but not the other!  Who would have thought?

The sound quality on these new fourth generation Echo speakers is horrible compared with the previous generation Echo speakers—all of them. What happened?I am so disappointed. I worked with Amazon tech-support, and even they said there must be something wrong, so they processed a return and shipped me a new set and they are equally horrible. I have read independent reviews on third-party websites, and watched them on YouTube, where reviewerss are saying Generation 4 is a total fail. I sure hope the fifth generation will go back to the sound quality of previous generations.I have had many speakers from every generation going back to the first generation (which ironically, was one of the best sounding speakers they made).Also, when you pair these fourth generation Echo speakers with a Fire TV or Fire TV stick, they are somewhat acceptable on the trailers and previews, since the volume of those, same with commercials, is so artificially boosted, (though the speakers are still disappointingly soft and poor quality), but the minute you start the actual show or movie, the sound instantly becomes so quiet that I would equate it to about a volume level 4 on previous generations.I think these were rushed to market because the engineers thought the new round shape was so cool. What was wrong with the previous shape? In a failed effort to “fix” the ain’t-broke design, they completely broke the function.

I bought this mainly to improve sound quality from the small tv in my kitchen after being disappointed with the Echo Studio. The dot was slightly better at connecting to my firestick 4k than the echo studio was, but not much. I frequently had to turn everything off then back on or fiddle with settings.I honestly didn’t notice a big difference between the echo premium and a standard echo. I’m sure there’s a more significant difference in sound quality at loud volumes but it was not worth it for me, as someone who takes it seriously when someone claims the audio output as a selling point.I eventually returned it for a standard echo 4th Gen and a $60 refurbished Sony sound bar. The sound quality is sooooo much better and the price difference was negligible after sales.

Easy to set up (make sure you download the app first) and link to your Amazon account. It will guide you through the setup.Sound is great and a lot better than I anticipated.

Perfect for listening while working.If you want a small speaker with 'nice' sound (not premium) for this price (granted it's not cheap cheap, but it is affordable), you may want to consider this little gem.I like the app as it prompts you with hints so you're not stuck trying to figure it our all at one time.

Beautiful sound system for the kitchen, family, and deck area. Paired on the Sidewalk subnet with an Amazon Subwoofer these babies crank out some seriously good music compared to my previous Echo Plus setup. I had to move the equalization to neutral. Plenty of tight bass, good midrange, and not so squeaky treble. I know this Sidewalk subnet helps with musical pairing. Be sure your sub is also on the Sidewalk. At first mine wasn’t and the bass was disjointed and my equalization was all over the map.

I connected the sub when it first arrived in March 2021. It worked great for a few months, then my system (6 Alexa units) stopped playing music and would not play on everywhere group. After much trial and error and research on line it appears many Alana sub users have the same problem. Many guess it’s a software update bug. The bottom lime the sub won’t pair with any of my other Alexa units and Amazon won’t address this problem anywhere. I would NOT buy this product.

I LOVED the 3rd gen Dot, which was my first foray into Alexa. So when the 4th gen Echo came out, I was hoping for better audio to play music in my living room space. With the Dot, I could quietly ask Alexa something, and she would pick up on it from 10-15 feet away. With this Echo, I have to repeat, and yell a bit for it pick up anything. THEN, the little ring will light up, and the Dot will answer from the other room -_-. I'm standing 5 ft away from the Echo, and about 30 feet away from the Dot. As far as the sound quality for music- it's a bit disappointing. It does seem to sound a touch better than the Dot's but not enough to justify the added cost and space that it takes up. If I had experienced this first, I think I would just try to hook up a better speaker to the Dot. I'm really glad that I gifted my friends the previous gen Dots (new ones weren't released yet), and not the new ones.

This iteration of the Echo started out very rough around the edges, but has gotten way better since I started to understand how the microphones are placed on it. It's far more linear in how it picks up your voice than the previous generation of Echo Dot that I was replacing. With a little tweaking, it's almost as good as the Dot was at hearing what I'm saying. The speaker quality is far superior than the Dot though. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this device.

I have 2 in a Stereo pair in my Office/Bedroom/music room, WoW, awesome audio and they really do sound Stereo. I haven't tried the Hub yet, I will update when I do, I purchased them for audio initially and am not disappointed. I have the equalizer set at default, no need to adjust them for the room they're in. I've tested them with various genre's of music and so far so good!Definitely recommend, especially if they're on sale. When ordering make sure you look at the options, I got 2 Hue bulbs with my second one at no extra cost (I haven't set them up yet).

I purchased Echo (4th Gen) to give it a try to Zigbee, since I'm starting to build my smart home. I'm upgrading from Echo dot (3rd Gen) and overall sound feels better but I find myself struggling from time to time trying to wake Alexa up, not sure where mics are place in this rounded model but the Echo dot is more sensitive to my voice so, there's room for improvement.Other than above comments, I think it is a good product if you consider it now has a smart hub built-in
","Positive"

The people writing negative reviews for this must be high, because the sound quality of this thing is amazing!Set it up, go into the equalizer in the Alexa app, bump up the treble 5 notches, bump up the bass 3-5 notches, turn down the mids 3 notches, then return the volume to Max and play some of your favorite music and prepared to be blown away by the sound that will come out of this very special little ball.If you're in the fence....  BUY IT!!!

I've had this for some time and I am updating my review.  The speaker sounds bad if there isn't enough space around it.  It is almost like the sphere shape was to make it sound good on all sides?  I had it in a couple smaller spaces and I didn't know what it could do until I moved and didn't block the sides.  So Amazon I am sorry for being jaded before.  I'd been hurt by other speakers before.

The Echo 4th generation (Echo 4) was on sale and included two smart bulbs. So I decided to buy the Echo 4 to replace my first generation Echo (Echo 1). Plus, I got a gift card for trading in my Echo 1.A great decision. I'm pleased with the sound quality of the Echo 4. Clearly a major improvement over the Echo 1. Also, easy to set up the smart bulbs using the Echo 4. Very helpful in that my wife recently had major back surgery and can use voice commands to turn lights off and on and make announcements for assistance.

This item was got through Amazon and was ""pre set"" for me.  It did not work properly with no microphone. After a walk through where I had to re set it myself, it worked, but he microphone became less and less responsive over the months that I continued to make payments. As soon as it was paid off, the microphone stopped responding to most commands.  Music playing in groups gets disrupted and stopped due to this device, while when unplugged, I get good music.  Customer service told me online that it will simply be replaced, since it is within warantee, and to follow instructions to send the bad one back.  After that communication, I was told differently online that it is a REPAIR request, that they are not honoring the warantee replacement, and that I have to send the item to Amaaon via UPS, have their technicans take it apart and analize it, then send it back to me.  So one customer service tells me that the new one is ordered and will be here in 3-5 business days, another tells me that I will get nothing until they get the broken one and fix it then send it back, and now I am on perpetual hold because the phone operators are too busy goofing off to actually provide any kind of completent assistance.

The latest echo looks good, sound great, but takes a couple of steps back.  The mic simply doesn't pick up the wake word as well as my previous (1st gen) Alexa, and we find ourselves often having to repeat it for her to pick it up.  Another nit-picky detail: the light is at the base of the echo, which makes it harder to see than when it was on top.  Otherwise, it's the same old Alexa.

This newest Echo is replacing my Dot, mostly because I wanted better sound quality. It definitely has very decent sound and I like that you can control treble and bass through the app.  I am somewhat disappointed in its lack of sensitivity to my voice once something is playing. I find I must repeat its name quite loudly before I can interrupt the existing music.  My dot seemed more responsive.  I guess it’s worth the slight aggravation for better sound quality.

Recent update.I found that I cannot control Echo voice volume. I tried to decrease Echo voice volume by pressing the volume button on the device, by using voice command, by using Alexa app on my cell phone. But nothing worked. Every time I decrease volume, it comes back to default in few hours, or in best case, in one day. So, next morning it is too loud again. It also, occasionally, stops playing music by itself in the middle of playing or just ignore my command to play after repeating my command. One time, out of sudden, it started playing music by itself. And I have exactly the same problem with Echo Dot.I had to change my rating from 3 to 2 stars.This is update.Echo Dot is a good device. It produces a decent sound and recognizes my commands without any problem. And it is convenient and funny. One of the reasons I purchased the Echo was to play songs without using my computer or CD or mp3 player or phone. However, when I  asked Alexa to play a particular song, for example Girl by the Beatles, Alexa replied that I have to sign up for a $3.99 per month account and played some other random song. If you already has some a paid music account then Echo will be a good choice for you. But this is not that I wanted. Will probably return it.

Integration with the app makes set up easy. Overall I prefer the 3rd generation Echo speakers I have. 4th generation, while soundi g equally good, due to their shape (spherical) take up more room on the counter. Microphone es are also weaker. The 3rd generation speakers hear my commands from much further away and often respond even though they are in the next room while these new (4th gen)  miss the same command while closer and in the same room as me.

It's a great upgrade coming from the third generation, the bass has a nice kick to it. Now with the zigbee integration I can easily pair various sensors that would otherwise require a hub.Really great product!

I marked it down to 4 stars just because I ordered black ones to blend in with my décor.  The black ones came with white power cords that just stand out.

Told him that was ridiculous.That aside, I like the new shape which is a gentler design. And the sound is really rich and vibrant.  Well worth the price if they could get their color matching right.

My older Echo Plus finally died and I wanted something with at least as good of sound quality.  Found this one with Dolby sound.  I listen to music mostly in my home office.

I traded up from the first gen echo. The sound quality is nicer and the device can hear you over the music etc it’s playing, unlike the first gen which I had to scream at and still couldn’t be heard over the music. Only downfall is it’s not as loud as the first gen. So while the sound is more crisp, it’s not as loud and doesn’t  provide sound throughout my home like my previous device. I had to purchase a second device (dot) for my bedroom

I asked my Echo ""what time is it"" and it answered correctly with saying my country.  Then I asked my Echo ""where do I live"" and it answers ""not sure"". This is why I said it is ""sluggish"". It can say my country when I asked the time, but can't say where I live. Other than that, it plays ""Fox News"" loudly.I purchased this product for $99 and a day after it dropped down to $69.

We haven't had any of the issues other reviewers have mentioned. The sound is amazing. Alexa isn't having a problem hearing us. The echo is located in the center of a large room at the end of a bar. Nothing around it. It detects  and responds to voices from every area of the open concept room.Our old first generation is great and in the bedroom now. Adding guard is a great new feature. Being alerted to a smoke detector alarm helps me feel more comfortable leaving our dogs alone for a few hours. I highly recommend this echo and am really enjoying it.

I love Alexa and own multiple Good evening.  ration of them starting from beta version. I highly recommend Alexa to everyone. However I am giving this 4the generation unit 3 stars as there is no significant difference between this and older version.  This newer unit works fine. I bought this newer 4th generation version thinking it must be better than the older version. I was disappointed as I don’t see a much of a difference at all. Sound quality is pretty much same as previous version.  Buttons and volume control ring is better in previous version. The older unit’s volume ring allows you to lower volume quickly with one smooth motion. In newer units you need to press small volume button multiple times to lower volume. This isn’t a show stopper as you can just voice control Alexa to lower volume. All this highlights is that controls were better thought thru in older unit.Bottom line I highly recommend Alexa to any 1st time user. However save yourself some money and buy older version as it works equally same as this newer version

A nice upgrade from the previous version. You probably either like the spherical shape or don’t. I think it’s fine, I don’t have a strong preference between the shape and the previous cylinders. The sound quality is good, and I do like to feature where you can tap it twice to turn off the alarm or reminder.

My husband ordered this and I was expecting a small sphere so when we received it I was like “whoa it’s giant” but after having it for awhile I don’t mind it. Like that you can play jeopardy and other games to pass time alone or with friends. Sometimes Alexa does foul up what you say but for the most part the voice recognition is pretty good. Convenient if you need to order anything from Amazon and don’t have/can’t use your phone at the time.

I upgraded my Gen 1 Echo to this Gen 4 and the difference is amazing!  The Gen 1 was still fully functional but the sound quality wasn’t the best. I bought one of these as a gift for Christmas and knew I wanted one.  The speaker quality is very good. Music sounds clearer and fuller and I can understand Alexa and talk radio much better.  Props to Amazon for their trade in program! With my trade in and discount I only paid $49 to upgrade.  Setup was quick and super easy.

Purchased in November - received in December 2020, with each passing week, getting a response has been an issue at times.  When standing over the Echo speaking clearly - no response.  Double checked the application, settings are in place but Alexa seems to randomly change/forget settings.  Music sounds great!  Definitely has improvements in sound quality.  Easy setup, smart home devices immediately detected. As far as the new design, it's massive!

I like the sound quality, ease of setup and that it can serve as a hub for all my alexa devices. I like the ""play music everywhere"" feature that will play the same music throughout the house on all connected echos. I do not like that is cannot work with my Schlage front door lock which uses z-wave vs zigbee. I would need to buy a separate hub for it to work with the door lock and the Echo would then communicate through the other hub I guess.

I feel as though this Echo has a much better sound. I have it in my living room and it seems to completely fill the room. It's not the same quality as a high-dollar speaker, but it's quite good. For me, none of the Echos do a wonderful job of word recognition (but to be fair, I'm from south Texas and there may be a bit of a language barrier).  I've been very pleased with the device, as well as their ability to connect and play music or news throughout the house.

I've had these devices for years, I am now constantly saying ""Alexa, shut up!"" as she blabs on with her ""by the way..."" suggestions. There is no way to shut this off.Automation is constantly adding duplicate devices, integrations with devices like Treatlife do not add the devices and it confuses the names of devices responding with things like ""...there is no device named potato light""I had hoped that this device with smart device support would fix issues, but it did not, and has no display. The do not make an echo with smart device support with a display (except the show echos)

Sound quality, ease of setup, integration with other Amazon devices all a plus. The only minus was I originally bought this to pair with a second generation Amazon Show for stereo sound, but found out this could not be done (me bad for not checking more carefully). I would hope Amazon could provide a fix for older Echos and the newer Echos to be paired for stereo sound. My new Echo is now an excellent computer speaker.

I bought the first echo device and loved it. I have purchase many echo dots since then (8-10). Our family loves them all. This fourth generation echo is subpar at best in my opinion.I have owned it for about a year now and the device does not respond as well as the dots. I wish I would have returned it when purchased because it does not function well as an Alexa Assistant.We are constantly having to repeat ourselves when sitting right beside the device. It often does not complete the requested task when it does hear us. It’s ability to listen and respond is far inferior to all the other echo dots we have (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation).The sound quality is good but that is not a significant selling point for me personally. I wanted Alexa to work well on a device with sound better/louder than the dot. That isn’t a high bar for sound quality since the dots are small. So, it meets my needs for sound quality but my bar is set low in that area.It does not meet my needs as an Alexa assistant in our main room of the house.

Hay cosas bastante desagradables con las que me he encontrado al configurar skills, hay varias que tienen restricciones geográficas innecesarias, si puedes usar la App en el teléfono, ¿a que se debe que la skill no puedas usarla en determinado país?

I contemplated this purchase for quite a while.  I've had one of the first generation versions since it was released and enjoy it immensely, but wasn't sure I wanted to expand into other areas of my home.  This addition allowed me to access my favorite internet radio stations and audio books without having to move anything or deal with less than stellar sound quality by using my Fire.It is the right size, not taking up a lot of space and blending into the background easily.  The sound quality is exactly what I expected.  Overall, I'm very pleased.

I like everything about this new speaker. The sound is very rich and the bass is almost as good as on the Echo Studio. Definitely a huge upgrade from the last version. I also like the physical design better. Much more appealing to my family. That said, it seems to have more trouble picking up our voice commands than earlier versions. Maybe they moved that mic around somewhere? I would have given it full 5 stars if not for that.

The sound quality is great.  Sometimes I have to repeat the wake word several times before it acknowledges me. This was not the case with my 3rd gen. With the response ring on the bottom, I can no longer see when it is lit from it current position.  I prefer the ring on top. Unless you like the new design, I don’t find any good reason to up grade. I upgraded because of the holiday price and the trade in credit.

Before this device I used a Google Nest.  The voice recognition on the Amazon Echo does not compare to Google Nest.  The Amazon Echo, gets confused about 40% of the times, this never happened with the Google Nest.  After 6 months of use, Alexa goes silent (no light) and the only way to fix this is to unplug and re-plug the device.  I have been patiently doing this, hoping the issue was going to get fixed on its own but for the last two month the issue is occurring more and more often and I now need to unplug/re-plug the device about every 2-3 days.  Another issue with the device is I usually have it at a low volume to listen to my tv (line in) and during the day I raise the volume but at the same time, Alexa’s volume is raised so when I say a command, Alexa is extremely loud.  I wish Alexa’s volume was separate to avoid this. Now let’s talk about warranty coverage...  It's unbelievably painful to find and get to warranty support for this device.  Once I found the link to chat, I was on a chat troubleshooting for about 2 hours.  At the end, when the agent decided to process the warranty, she wanted me to ship the item first to Amazon, wait a few days for them to process it and then send me the replacement.  The agent then told me she couldn't process it and asked me to delete my home address and re-enter (to check, if that was going to allow her to process the request).  I requested to have a supervisor call me and as I'm writing this, I'm still waiting for the supervisor to take some type of action.

Great quality sound with deep tones, all in a portable speaker that can go anywhere when you combined with the charging stand like we did. Now we can have the same music by the pool as we have in the house for a fully immersed music experience. Voice recognition with Alexa is flawless. She changes music selection, volume, as well as her usual control of our devices and answering our questions. Now if I could only get Alexia to serve drinks by the pool!

The sound quality of this is great, although the speakers are more directional than the older vertical design. First and foremost, I love my multiple Echo and Echo dot units (I have six in total); one red and white with the others all being charcoal (black). All are 3rd Gen. the red and white one came with a white cord/adapter to match. ALL of the others in charcoal came with black cord/adapter. I went ahead and ordered the 4th Gen echo sphere in charcoal, and was irritated to see that they had put a white cord/adapter in the box. I contacted Amazon, and they told me the charcoal units should ship with black cord/adapter, not white, which doesn't match at all, and stands out as looking ""mismatched"" with the unit. Amazon sent me another unit which arrived yesterday a charcoal Echo with a WHITE CORD AND ADAPTER. It simply doesn't look right and I can't ""hide"" it. I took a chance on orderingthe new spherical design, and may end up returning both units and sticking with the 3rd Gen units I have. I don't understand why Amazon wouldn't continue matching the units with a cord color that corresponds with the color of the Echo unit. This is too big and they never should have messed with the vertical design. Hate the directional speakers and the bottom light. I may return all my ""balls"" and find the original designs. As usual, Amazon has to call something ""improved"" when it's the exact opposite. Very disappointed!

Regardless of when you bought your Echo (this one or other modsls), they are now disabling music features. You used to be able to play a song on demand as long as it was included in the free music, but now it will only play “similar songs” in a shuffle. I called customer support and they said they disabled that ability. That’s the most common thing we use ours for, and I can’t imagine what else they will disable to force us to buy several monthly subscriptions under the Amazon brand

In recent months, I've upgraded my Alexa devices to include Studio, Dot and most recently an Echo. The Echo has very good sound and audio. I haven't used the smart hub its causing me a little flux. Can't seem to get one Phillips Hue bulb to connect. On the other hand, all devices work well with the Wiz app.The feature I like most about the Echo is the temperature sensor. Simply ask Alexa for the temperature of the Echo, or whatever you've named it, and Alexa provides you with the current internal temperature.

Echo Ball is nice but doesn't have the sound quality difference as promoted. Sounds very similar to the previous Echo Dot. I was hoping to connect it to my TV for better sound quality, but it's not loud enough...TV provides better sound.The smart bulb frequently loses connection to wifi, so Alexa has a hard time turning them on/off consistently.

I've had some problems switching over to the Echo 4 from a Gen 2 Echo Plus. The painter knocked over the Echo Plus and damaged it, so he bought me the Echo 4. I had a couple of Philips bulbs that disappeared from Alexa when I made the switch over. I couldn't figure out how to get them to work. I finally bought some Gosund bulbs and had trouble setting them up too. Fortunately, Alexa Customer Service helped me to get them working. I'm still in a honeymoon period with the Echo 4 but expect good things from it once I get the differences worked out.

This is a definite improvement over the gen. 2 echo speaker. The sound is more surround and clear sounding, plus a nice boost in bass capability. The older one I had to just about turn the bass off or it would sound like the speaker was blown out and rattly.

Sound: 3/5Design: 2/5Alexa Hub: 4/5Mic: 2/5I was looking forward to getting the 4th generation echo, I wasn't sure about it after reading all the reviews but I thought I will give it a try anyhow.I had the 1st generation Echo which was getting replaced by the 4th generation. I didn't really care for the 4th generation sphere design but I had hoped that the technology will make up for it. I was wrong the Echo Dot in the other room answers my questions 😂🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ very disappointed!!! Never had such an issue with 1st generation Echo, now I think why did I replace it in the first place. It even used to prompt if I got the response from the right device.The most disappointing is the Amazon support not helpful at all. When I reached out to the Chat support they gave me the excuse device software was out of date, I asked why it didn't update automatically, they told me device needs to be idle for half hour. Forget during the day when everyone is awake, it didn't find an idle time at night as well when everyone was asleep 🤣😂I was able to reproduce the issue today, I asked the Echo 3 questions but every time the Echo Dot in the different room responded and when I called Amazon support, they asked me to reproduce the issue even though they could see in my voice history which device responded to the questions.I tried to reproduce the issue when I was on call, it didn't happen, they said we will call in an hour. I never heard back from Amazon support and instead got an email saying they couldn't reach me. Very disappointed!!Verdict: I won't suggest to upgrade...poor device and very horrible customer service. 1st generation Echo was definitely louder and I preferred the overall design. The issues with the mic are annoying.P.S. Don't give excuses to someone who is from software industry 😏

I purchased this device on the release date and it has been giving me issues ever since. The main problem is the response time when I say the wake work and it not listening after I start to ask a question. I know this may not be the same experience with many people but compared to the echo studio this seems way slower. I have tried different trouble shooting tips to no avail. I am going to reach out to amazon support to see if there is a solution but I just believe my device my be defective.The sound quality for this device is great and an improvement over the previous generations of the echo and I actually like the design. Besides the lag in responding I would be very happy with the device but it really get annoying when you ask it something it takes seconds to acknowledge you and then when you ask a question it just shuts off. If not for that this would be five stars all across.

""Alexa, play Spotify"" - yeah right. This skill seldom works and you have to constantly re-authorize your Spotify account and use the Alexa app to start it up. This is why the Spotify skill has 12,000+ reviews and only 2 stars. Why is this? Platform inoperability, which is as old as the tech industry itself. What it means is that developers have a positive disincentive to make their product work with a competitor's product. Is it hard left to make Spotify work on this device? Probably not. Do Amazon or Spotify want it to work? Definitely not, and that is how we end up here.

This is our “newest Alexa” 4th generation (we have and use 3 others in our house), and we are very pleased with this model!!  this one is definitely “top notch” and the most sophisticated one...works  better than the first 3 generation-ones!!  The Sound is of a much higher quality - - you can talk a little bit faster into it and it understands everything (generally on the first time, and you don’t have to repeat yourself), AND, the music sound (its speaker) is unmatched/ would absolutely recommend the “4th generation” to anyone considering on buying an ALEXA!!!!

The sound on this Echo is noticeably better than the previous model.  In fact, it has amazing sound quality for such a small unit.  The only thing I do not like about this is the stupid white cord!  Amazon could at least offer a black cord.  Not all of us have white walls.  Thus the 4 star rating.  Other than that...very pleased with this 4th gen.

And that is not all.  What do you want to know? Just ask Alexa.  But the musical quality is great.  I had no idea that a 3"" ""woofer"" coiuld vibrate my solid desktop.  In fact, after buying the first one, I bought a second because they can easily be set up (using a cell phone app) to provide real stereo sound.  First speakers I ever bought without hearing them first. I could not be happier!

hate its hard to see the leds, why did amazon hide them? its the best part of the devices itself. i notice i have to damn near yell the wake words for it to pop up and recognize the wake words. its sound sounds just like the gen 3. only thing different is it has zigbee and that's the only reason it was bought. i could have don't with out a new unuseable echo.

My husband loves Van Morrison -  Alexa makes it so easy to enjoy music throughout the day with just a voice request.  Plus we upgraded to the $3.99 Amazon music subscription for an even broader range of music selections on this device.  Will seriously consider the largest Echo player when we move to a new house in the near future and look forward to figuring out how to link all three!

Fairly okay overall but for what I paid for it I would expect certain things to perform a little better.For one the echo speaking volume is lower than the music volume. For instance when I ask her to respond she responds in very low volume but then when she goes back to music it's back to a normal volume.  When you change the software volume slider then it has the music blasting.The other problem for such a big globe which took place of the spherical Dot that I replaced it with;. It seems to have trouble understanding the Wake word unlike any of my other previous generation echo devices.And in general it clearly has a hearing problemLike some others have written I assume there's a software fix for these issues, but it's a nuisance to have a 4th generation product  have such issues right out of the box so to speak..

The music feature is good.  Have not tried the shopping list.  Have been turning out my own light for 70 years and see no need for an electronic device to do that for me.  I am sure there are other features that we will probably never use.  Maybe we will get 2 of the small ones to put in other rooms so we can communicate better.  I love all the new devices, but doubt this one will be on the top of my list.  My wife likes it and that is all that matters

The Echo 4th GenWas skeptical when I bought the Echo Dot. Used it daily and as I aquired smart tech the app bridged connections quite well and maintained them exquisitely. I am always eager to say Alexa's name when to turn on and off various rooms, dartboard, individual switches, outlets, and various other devices all by voice. And by having multiple echo devices scattered throughout the house makes it easy to control without yelling. Another feature I use is Amazon music subscription. Always cool to hear tunes through this new Echo.

I am absolutely loving my new Echo! Love the shape, the design, the sound quality..I have NO complaints at ALL! This Echo seems to be much more 'responsive' than my old one was well. There were times when my old Echo/ Alexa ""didn't understand"" or just didn't respond to a request. I am overall VERY satisfied with my decision to ""upgrade"" to a new Echo vs. moving my old Echo, as I just recently moved. VERY happy. 5 Stars all the way around.

I was one of the first to receive the initial Echo in 2014 and have owned some iteration of each generation except the new Studio. This by far has the best sound and bass. The vocals could be a little louder, but am thinking future updates will provide further refinements. I have the blue one and new design is a cool look, with the exception of the white cord, which just doesn't match very well. The built in hub is great and automatically setup all my connected devices for me. Well done.
","Positive"

I wanted to love it, hoping it was going to sound better than the previous generation, instead I hate it. My old one actually hears me in the living room while I’m yelling at the one in my bedroom it’s ridiculous. I wish I could get my money back for it. I think maybe it’s the new design or  Maybe it’s just a flawed because it’s a ball, I don’t know…It’s useless to me unless I am right next to it.

The Echo device has good sound quality and mostly good voice recognition.  It does not play well with streaming Sirius XM though that is one of its capabilities.  The Alexa app can be a tangled mess at times making it difficult to navigate to the desired function to control Echo.  This last issue easily detracts at least one full star from the rating.

Is a great product as every Amazon device.  I can't give 5 starts because the design is not good for me, is too big. Definitely love the prior design.

Most of the time works great and I love listening music... that is the best part.

Love the sound, love the shape I traded in my 1st gen echo ( didn't want to let it go 😥) to up grade again (I have a 3rd gen also). So I aware of all the things Alexa can do i have one in every room. My only disappointment is why did it come with a WHITE power cord???😫😵? Why not BLACK like all the others???? Or a white cord with a white echo and black with black echo ??? Just makes sense to me..I'm gonna ask for a black cord and see what happens... Stay tune for a update

First off, it's ugly. Really a big let down. Amazon's first alexa was the best design. They should fire whoever is in charge of the design of this device. I really appreciate the volume ring so much more than the + - buttons for volume.Next, is that that it works okay. Sound is fairly decent but the connect between the device and the Amazon ""cloud"" is really buggy. Sometimes, it'll play all day. Other days it will stop after about 20 minutes. It doesn't seem to understand what I say sometimes as well. It will either not do anything or do something entirely different. And if you say anything to it, it refers you to the support section of the app.The idea is great but it's not done well. They need to rehire some folks and return to the cylinder shape. Hopefully with the volume ring instead of buttons. My original alexa is still functioning flawlessly. Wish they still had that quality.Good luck.

 Awesome sound quality!  Rich & robust, deep bass. As you can see the echo dot gen 2-3 has graduated from Kevin Hart to Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in size.  :) The gen 4 dot is much bigger in size and sound. Hope you can hear it on the video.  Now there's 2 version of 4th gen echo dot..I have the one with premium sound.  I also like that it has an internal hub and was able to effortlessly link up with the Phillip Hue  and Sengled smart light bulbs.

Sound quality is good.  Could be better still.  Maximum volume needs to be increased.  It gets loud but not as loud as I feel it could or should go. All the voice recognition items seem to work just as intended.

We have two hubs and a dot. The one that *I* actually bought is the only one that doesn't work right. Or - sometimes it does. It's just that sometimes it doesn't. It hears ""Alexa"" but frequently ignores whatever I say after that - as if I'd said nothing at all. It *should* tell you it doesn't understand what you said, but it just acts like it heard nothing. The other two echos are fine, though. Just bad luck

I had been an early adopter of the Echo.  Heard this model was a big improvement in sound quality, I would second that.  Nice look, an orb, so to speak, pleasant colored light on the base.  My biggest impression was with support.  Somehow my Bluetooth had locked into my Sonos speakers, which were not even plugged in.  I just could not get the new Echo to give out any sound, other than the voice query.  Managed to get ahold of support, they talked me through a reset works fine now.

Setting up the echo was very easy to do and took little time to get it up and running. I have had a blast using it and trying out new things with it. I really like the weekly tips and suggestions Amazon sends out in an email form to keep me trying new things with it ang getting the most out of it. In time i am looking forward to setting up home automation with my echo. It did come with 2 smart bulbs which were also very easy to set up and use with my echo system.

Had this new Echo 4Gen for a few weeks and really like it. Easy to sync with my Nest Thermostats and the Cue light bulbs. I also like that it immediately notified me of incoming Amazon orders. It looks cool - so far no complaints. I also like getting emails from Amazon with suggestions on how I can use the Echo and what it can do for me. Great support - good suggestions! Since I set it up initially, it seems to first recognize my voice better than my wife's, but that has gotten better now as it learns.

I think all Alexa devices get incredibly confused during voice assisted Bluetooth connections. For example, saying “Alexa (firetv) connect bluetooth to Echo” meaning, play sound through echo speakers. Often enough to complain, echo will trying playing through the fire tv instead of how the command is set. Little things with Bluetooth connectivity I think could be improved, and the echo dots have just at par speaker quality. The true shinning audio comes from the echo, not the dot.

Hey! This sounds great!It looks a bit silly, but it’s great. It replaces both a reliable Dot and a UE bluetooth speaker (which just didn’t make using it easy, even though I like my UE).I had an Echo Studio in here, but preferred using it elsewhere.So far, this new Echo the 4th has reliably picked up my voice and responded well.It paired easily with my iPhone and iPad. It doesn’t have the deep boom of the UE or the Echo Studio. It gets loud enough and has a balanced sound.It feels poised to be here awhile.Recommended

It was relatively easy to set up. I had an echo dot in its present place and moved the dot to the kitchen. The setup 'colors' never coincided with the instructions (yellow vs orange) but I still continued with process and it worked. It kept some of the automation and some were not kept (outside lights on/off). Otherwise good deal.The sound quality (music and response) is sharper and has a wider range for music.
","Positive"

Voice recognition matches far more than it fails.  IFTTT integration is great and easy.Alexa voice sound quality is pleasant.  I have not been able to listen to music because music integration with Tidal, and for that matter Spotify and Amazon, is terrible.  Alexa refuses to look at my playlists on Tidal making music playback useless.

I ordered a black echo to place in my kitchen. The device works well, and the set up is easy. However, it comes standard with a white cord now, which is not disclosed when you place the order.  It looks ridiculous, and it appears like a mismatched cord with another device.  If you order red - you get a white cord.  Grey - white cord.  Blue - white cord...  After working with Amazon customer support, I was told to order a new black cord and pay for it, and they would let me then request a refund on the matching cord.  What??!!  Anyway, the device is fine, and I would give a five-star review to the device otherwise.

My first Alexa. I love it. I loved it so much I bought two Echos the very next day.

The sound for music is better.  The design is different, still deciding if I like it better or just different.  The front facing speakers as opposed to cylindrical doesn't seem to pick up my voice.  Always yelling ""ALEXA""!  Many times have to say Alexa 2, 3 or 4 times before she picks it up.  If not directly in front of the speaker the voice recognition is poor.  If music is playing or the TV is on, you have to speak loud and clear or she doesn't hear.  It is this speaker, because I have two others on the main level of the house and sometimes one of them will pick up my voice from 20 feet away in a different room and the new 4th generation in the same room with me just sits there.  Not sure if it's worth the frustration or constantly repeating commands to get the better sound quality.  Debating about just returning and waiting for a 5th generation with a better quality microphone.

After about three months of use, I can honestly say it's a great product. Definitely recommend!

Not seeing a great improvement over the gen 3, if anything it may actually be a step back.

First thing I got after receiving my stimulus was this and boy let me tell you I have zero regrets. I've had the original first Gen Alexa this entire time and it worked just fine so no need to upgrade. And if ever I felt the need to listen to music with some bass I connected my Alexa to my bookshelf speakers over a 3.5mm cord. Well no more of that nonsense with the arrival of this baby. This outperforms my bookshelf speakers, hands down. Loving every second of this gadget.

I've been a fan of the Echo since its inception.  In fact I've had each of the 4 generations (including this one).  I wish I had stayed with the 3rd Gen.  Alexa seems to be getting old, her hearing isn't what it used to be.  I find I have to repeat ""Alexa"" on several occasions for her to respond, as well as repeating requests.  I listen to Amazon Music, and it sounds a little muffled at times.  Not sure if I just have a poor unit or if these points need to be addressed in the next generation.

I am a huge fan of Amazon's products and I love how I was able to integrate Alexa with my firestick, smart switches and lamps, or just use it as a Bluetooth device.But -1. Auto Bluetooth Connect - Alexa announces whenever a bluetooth device is connected. You dont have any control over that to disable Auto-Connect. You might be listening to music on your phone and then you powerup your laptop and it will connect to your laptop and switches back and forth sometimes. The only solution Amazon has given, is to Forget your device from bluetooth settings EACH time you are done using it.2. Announcements! - I tried disabling this but Alexa wont stop announcing every time I connect a device to Alexa and its so loud. Sometimes Alexa randomly connects to my phone in the *middle of the night* (because there may be a notification on my phone).It goes like ""NOW CONNECTED TO REDMI NOTE PRO""! at 3 AM!!!

The premium sound is wonderful.  I can ask Alexa to play any of my favorite songs and she can locate them. Whether it is Amazon music or a radio station that features that genre that I like, she can find it.  She gives the weather, sends reminders, helps me keep up with my schedule, history facts of the day, etc.  Then she says Good night... I just love Alexa.  Because she can power on and off my smart plugs, I am really happy.  I would recommend the all-new Echo for everyone!

 I have been an early adopter of Amazon technology for the better part of a decade. This is my first full-size echo although, I have had the show, show 2, show 5, show 8 and every other generation of dot including this new fourth GEN. This is amazing. The sound is unparalleled, even by a wonderful Harmon Karmen speaker that has a ALEXA built-in. I can’t wait to get deeper into its capabilities but, just the first few hours have left me in awe.  Happily, I support Product (RED).

I enjoy using echo devices but the echo fourth generation device has much difficulty calibrating the temperature sensor.

I like my toys to work - I am disappointed with this new toy.

I don't like the new shape, it takes up more space on my small nightstand. I would've added a pic but Amazon wanted complete access to my camera and pics rather then me selecting one pic to add. The 3rd gen was better, 360 sound and light ring on top. The 4th gen bowling ball isn't 360, you have to put it's back towards a wall. Light ring is now on bottom of ball and is almost impossible to see the yellow ring of light during the daylight when you need it to receive weather alerts from the National Weather Service. The sound might be slightly better if you're standing in front of it but I'd rather have another 3rd gen and not this bowling ball. Don't fix what's not broken! I won't be buying anymore until they return to the cylinder 360 shape with the light ring on top.

It's my first echo. I resisted. It's cool. I have nothing for anyone to listen to so I'm ok with it. Unless someone wants to know what people say to their dogs, I'm pretty sure no one wants to listen.That being said, if you're talking crazy stuff, I'd probably avoid Alexa, microphones, etc.I like the smart sh#*. It's too easy and convenient not to use. Hate to admit it. You should get one, unless ......

Excellent sound quality and ease of use. However if you have two or more speakers setup as a group you cannot operate both speakers at the same time with your phone. Tech support had me try various troubleshooting measures before finally advising me you can only control one speaker at a time with your iPhone. Other than this issue they meet expectations.

I already had a few 3rd generation Echo Dots, and 1) Wanted to add a hub, 2) Was intrigued by the press reviews of the 4th generation devices. So when the “limited edition” Echo Red was issued I eventually decided to give it a try as it fits with the Feng Shui of the place it’s in. So, how’d it work out?Pros:• Sound quality is definitely better (in my space).• Woo-Hoo, I’ve got a hub!• This particular edition, the Red, suits my decor schema perfectlyCons• The microphone doesn’t work well. I’ve enough devices that this is largely immaterial, but let’s just say it’s obvious that’s this is not the device I’m talking to. That’s kinda sad as that also means I’m rarely interacting with Alexa over the new chipset.• Sad but true: As others have noted 4th generation devices do not pair with other generation devices. Sad. I can’t use this as part of a stereo pair. (Here’s hoping Amazon issues a software patch!)

Use for playing music and podcasts. Alexa can't find a significant number of albums and podcasts I wish to listen to which is frustrating. Also, can't figure out how to delete some activity that shows up multiple times.

I’ve been an Alexa user for years and have loved it. I loved the features and the ease it brought to my life. The sound quality of this gen is great; the aesthetics are lovely. I never had a problem with Alexa and Alexa devices—until I upgraded to this gen. If you’re considering it, stop. Don’t do it. I have had nothing but trouble. And I’m not alone. Google it. The problem is pervasive and persistent.I plugged it in initially around Dec 1 and have regretted it since. My device randomly plays audacy at an absurd volume and won’t always shut off—sometimes I have to unplug it to get it to stop. I have tried resetting it, reinstalling the app, factory restores, removing all devices from my account, removing all skills/apps from the device, etc. I’ve watched videos, read help pages, and asked friends in IT to help. Nothing—NOTHING—resolves the issue. I have taken my Alexa down to no skills or apps. Basically it’s now an automated list maker and it STILL randomly plays Audacy (and by “plays” I mean “screams”). It only plays Audacy; nothing else…although it recently started to randomly beep at me. My privacy settings are as locked down as they can be and still—still—the problem remains.Don’t. Do. It. Go to a different system and let Amazon work through its issues in someone else’s home. I’ve had this gen for about 3 months and it’s spent about 1/3 of that time unplugged because the anxiety these random musical attacks trigger makes the whole system not worth it.I miss my Alexa.

Al comprar el Echo 4, y venir de un Echo Dot 3, pensé que el cambio sería importante, pero realmente el Echo Dot 3, hace lo mismo. en cuanto a reconocimiento de Voz, el Echo Dot 3 reconoce la vos mucho mas rapido y por ende responde mejor. en cuanto a Sonido, el Echo 4 es mejor y cumple lo necesario en sonido, pero no espere un sonido de alta calidad.

My old Echo Plus was able to pick up the ""Alexa"" wake word from across the room.  This 4th Gen needs a hearing aid.  You need to be standing next to it to hear you.  And I also like how to change the volume on the old one by turning the dial; this one has old fashion plus / minus buttons.Again, good sound but the mic is poor and the button design is not what I'd expect.

I have multiple echo devices and in general think they're great. I was disappointed a bit that this 4th gen device was not as good at recognizing its wake word ('Alexa'), as my older echo devices.  With the 4th generation device I have to be very careful to directly face the unit and enunciate when using the wake word.  My older units do not require this.(FWIW - I've altered the positioning of this 4th gen device a few times to ensure it wasn't some sort of audio bouncing that was the issue. The unit performs the same regardless of its location.)Also, unlike my older devices, this 4th generation Echo seems to often just not respond if it cannot answer or properly interpret a voice command/request.  I can see the wake word activates the unit but then it does not respond to commands it has trouble with. I have mixed feelings about this.  I don't miss the occasional 'I did not understand that request' (paraphrasing the response older Echo devices used.) but at the same time really dislike the device just going silent as though nothing had been said - and forcing me to wake it again.To be clear - the issues with this 4th generation device are truly minor.I remain a big fan of echo devices and Alexa in general.Solid build quality, excellent speech interpretation, amazing performance overall.

I have a 3rd gen echo dot in my bedroom and decided to purchase the new Echo 4th gen so I could put it in my open concept living area.  The sound really fills the space nicely.  I used the play everywhere feature so I could hear the music while walking between my room and the kitchen and that's when I really noticed the sound quality difference.  I thought the 3rd gen dot had pretty good sound for such a small unit but this 4th gen model has far better bass and deeper tones.
","Positive"

Update: Changed up to 3 stars. I received a call from amazon and they helped me fix the long delay issue. You cannot have it give a tone when you say the wake word, something that I liked. The bad is that the temp sensor is always way off. I have 2 different sensors in the same room to check and it's about 10deg off. I got this so that I can have it turn on and off an ac unit at specific temps. The room gets over 80deg while the rest of the house is like 70deg. The sensor in the echo will say it's 71 but all the other sensors will say 80 in this room.Update: changed this to a 1 star. I constantly have to repeat commands to my echo and then it will take about 60 seconds to complete them, if it ever does complete them.Love the sound quality but it takes longer than my 3rd gen echo dot did to execute commands.

The sound out of this small sphere is pretty impressive, I have this out on covered patio and it does well.

Works great!! I put this in my studio to have good sound playing while I tattoo and it’s perfect! It is loud and you can increase bass etc. I don’t need anything crazy loud so this was perfect to have all around good sound speaker for some background music.

I have everything from the very first generation (still have my original, I got it during the trial release) through to this one.  The sound quality improved with the second and third generation, but I feel that this round one it went down.  It's harder to hear the responses, even with the volume up, and if not for the fact I have my music play through multiple devices, I would say the music sort of sucks as well.  I would opt for the earlier releases.  I don't need the hub, I have my own good setup at home, so that's not a reason to get it for most people either.

Fourth time with 4th Generation Echo was NOT the charm.We have the older Echo as well as the Echo Dot. These work great. This new Echo is awful!We are now on our THIRD 4th generation Echo. The first one (Round One) hooked up beautifully to all our devices, but was totally hard of hearing. We would stand 2 feet away from Alexa and scream to get her to respond. This device is located on our main floor. The device in our bedroom a floor up and rooms away would respond before the one two feet away did. So Amazon send us a new one. This was after spending 45 minutes on the phone with customer service.Round Two 4th generation hears perfectly well but is completely was unable to connect with out two brand new Philips Hue light bulbs which were part of the package that came with Round One. Chatted first with someone in the US on fixing this. Seemed like we might be getting somewhere but she put me on hold. Next thing I knew I was talking with someone in India (I think) explaining the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN. He put be through to someone in the Philippines. Starting from scratch AGAIN I was on the phone with her for 57 minutes!!! It was truly the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result! She finally says something is wrong with your 4th generation ECHO and ships me another new one.Round Three 4th generation Echo arrives today. Same nightmare as Round Two. Spent 40 minutes on the phone with Amazon Customer services. He states that the only literature he has to go off of is really old!!! Echo is STILL NOT ABLE TO SEE new Philips Hue Lights! He tells me to contact Philips Hue.I've now been on the phone with Philips Hue for 60 minutes! Still not working.Amazon's customer service is NOT knowledgeable about this issue!

The goodClear audio at low and mid volume. Temperature sensor is a nice addition.The neutralHas some kind of onboard voice processor but I don't notice any improvements to voice recognition or response speed as a result.The badDoesn't hear me as well as my 3rd Gen EchoDoesn't sound good above 50% volume - it's as if the device just increases the treble only and can't increase volume on low-mid frequency beyond the 50% threshold. Above 70% it starts to distort, above 80% it's distorted to all heck. Would be better if the max volume was limited to match the device capabilities instead of allowing users to crank beyond the distortion threshold. Essentially, in the current state we only get 5 usable volume levels. Above that it just sounds terrible.For reference, the 3rd Gen echo I find to sound decent up to about 70% volume before noticeable distortion occurred. In addition the 3rd Gen can actually hear me so I'd just recommend skipping the 4th generation.

I just set this up at my parent's house for them. I bought this for my dad's birthday. He saw a TV commercial with an Alexa and thought it was ""cool"". Whatever. Anyway, the sound from the device is really nice with tons of bass. While my parents were screaming at each other over passwords, who has them, who forgot them, where they are, I easily set it up. The background screaming didn't even affect the voice recognition! I never thought I would buy one for my family but I must say I'm impressed with the device.

First off, to off set all of the PICKY princesses that cant seem to handle a white power cord with a black Echo, the cord does what is is intended to, it powers the device!  My Black Echo (4th Generation) works great and has much better sound than the previous two versions.  It arrived in the mail, set-up was easy, and the ""un-godly"" white cord worked and supplied power.  No bo-hoo here about the cord or directional sound, the 4th gen echo is the best one yet.  The power cord is white, get over it.

Great bass. Treble? Not so much. I asked Alexa too turn down the bass (she did, all the way), and turn up the treble (she did, all the way), but the unit simply doesn't have clarity of even a simple clock radio.

I use this product with the digital streamer to connect it to my stereo system the Alexa by itself or the echo by itself does not have sufficient sound quality for me but when it's played through my stereo speakers it sounds much much better I have an older system that doesn't have streaming capabilities but by adding the streamer and connecting it to my CD port on the back of my receiver I get what I wanted.

The Echo 4th Generation model is good if you don't mind needing to plug it in for it to work. There is no built in battery. If it is not plugged in to a power source, it will not work.

Set up of my Echo (Alexa) was extremely easy and fast.  It recognized my voice with just a few phrases in the instructions provided.

This is a good speaker/alexa. Here's the problem: the marketing tells you that you can pair this echo with a fire tv ""to feel scenes come to life with home theater audio."" The reality is that audio can only come from EITHER your tv's speakers OR your echo. NOT BOTH. It isn't a home theater experience at all unless you want to buy multiple echo devices. And then it is only possible to pair the fire tv with a maximum of 2 echo devices and a sub. So even if you want to spend extra money, it's going to be a subpar ""home theater"" experience.  It took me an hour on customer service getting passed around before I was told that it was impossible to get sound from both the tv speakers and the echo at the same time (despite the fact that it will do this to play music, according to customer support it is not possible while watching tv). Hopefully this review will save others some time!

My echo, seem to have trouble staying connected and following through with task from the beginning. I contacted Amazon about this I was told there was nothing wrong with it and it just needed to be updated. After the update it continued to glitch out, over a year of fighting the echo. It finally stopped responding, I contacted Amazon. They troubleshooted the device multiple times, they couldn’t fix it. I was told its out of warranty and if I would have contacted them before hand with my problems that they could of helped but all they can do it give me a 15% discount on a new echo. I explained I did contact them before was told my device was fine and pointed this out. I was told sorry but I could buy a new one. Then the new one I looked at couldn’t ship to my address for whatever reason, but I told I could upgrade my device and pay double for the new echo with the 15% discount. Then after my purchase that Amazon will credit my account 10% of my new purchase. I feel like I got a faulty item from the beginning and was given the run around about the item and convinced the echo was fine. So I just assumed it was my internet being slow, which made since until I got a echo show for Christmas and it works perfectly without any problems. So now I have a echo show and a echo dot that’s just sitting on my shelf not responding at all.

I purchased a 4th gen Echo dot, but meant to purchase a 4th gen Echo.  A few days later, there was a price drop on the 4th gen Echo, so I bought one and compared them.First, I should've realized the price dropped for a reason... the reviews which state that the Echo mic is bad are so true.  I have to speak so loud (even when no other sounds in the room), I can be heard two rooms away.When Alexa does respond, there's a serious lag and the volume temporarily decreases (long enough that I thought I'd accidentally asked Alexa to lower the volume) only to realize this happens every time I ask Alexa anything.The Echo sound is relatively full.  However, I prefer the midrange of the Echo dot.I don't care for either device as a single speaker so I tried to pair the Echo and the Echo dot.What??  Each speaker pairs individually with FireTV, smart light bulbs, etc., but an Echo and Echo dot will only work together for music and, possibly, audio books.They CAN'T BE PAIRED together for stero listening with, e.g., FireTV.  I researched this to ensure I wasn't missing something and all web results verified this issue.  Please let me know if I'm wrong!Bottom line, I'll be returning the 4th gen Echo for sure.  Might keep the 4th gen Echo dot.

But alas that not what I received. So be very careful when ordering & double check. I did and still received the wrong one! Very disappointed in Amazon for how they do things. I even called them and there replie was, call back in four days. How does that help me or anyone else that would have this problem. Very disappointed...!

Really like the new shape of the 4th generation echo.  I think the sound is rich with good bass tones and clear trebles.  Of course I don't expect a hi-fi stereo sound out of the unit, but it plays cleanly.  I also got the battery base which is also great allowing me to take it anywhere i need it.  I will be adding dots to the home and love the fact that the Echo has a smart hub built in so integration is really easy

I love my echo, the only thin that sucks is that it inly plays playlists from Apple Music not just your library, and sometimes it doesn't say it has access to the playlist even if it is connected t wifi

The sound and look of the speaker is great however as mentioned in other reviews, the microphone is really bad, it literally SUCKS!!! I bought 2 echos, one for my living room and another for my bedroom, both sit at about 5-6 ft away from where I regularly speak to them from and when they are not reproducing anything I have a hard time getting them to hear me. Not to mention when the music is on, especially on high volume, you literally have to SCREAM to have a possibility of them hearing you. This is both with the dot and echo 4th gen, for comparison I have 3rd gen echo dots, echo show 5 and echo flex, needless to say they all hear me waaaaay easier, to give an idea of this: I have an echo flex out in my hallway outside of my bedroom and sometimes it hears me before the echo in the room, despite it being easily an additional 5ft away with walls in the way. It's very disappointing that they downgraded the microphones on these for whatever the reason, especially because one of it's main features to sell is you being able to communicate through voice, for this reason I have to give it a 2 star rating regardless of all it's pros. I really hope Amazon look into this and either gives a recall or some sort of update that can fix this problem

It streams music. It plays games. It is an alarm clock and a timer. It answers questions. It can tell me if there are any Korean restaurants in the area. Or what is the outside temperature. You can even make it sound like Samuel L. Jackson. I set my Echo to answer to ""Computer"" instead of ""Alexa."" It's that Star Trek...I now have them all over my home. There is nothing like having a ""Bathroom Alexa"" or an ""Alexa in the Kitchen.""

As a stand alone speaker/Alexa assistant it works as advertised.  Impressed with the sound.  However, very disappointed in the difficulty to set-up additional Echo Dots throughout the house.  Have yet to figure out a good solution to allow our kids to each have an Echo Dot that is linked to their own Spotify account and still be able to use the intercom functionality.  Can't link an Echo Dot to a Kids or Teen Amazon account but only two adult accounts are allowed so two Echos/Dots no issue but more then that is a real pain.  Seems to make the intercom feature useless unless you want to all be linked to the same Spotify account and only be able to listen to music on one Echo at a time.  Not well thought out and very frustrating.

I have several echo devices, all models.  New Gen4 arrived and setup,  but unable to set alarm sound to what I want, it's stuck to default tone.Worked with support to:  unplug/restart; reset echo gen 4;  uninstall alexa from iphone and ipad; log out of alexa on iphone.  nothing lets me change it.Tried changing from web, iphone, ipad as well, so it's not iOS related on app side.  Has to be physical device imo.All other echo devices working fine, can change alarms or default alarm to any I want, just this new echo stuck on default sound.  Ticket opened for engineering.

Easy set up, voice recognition is great and the sound quality when playing music is pretty awesome. I don't have other Alexa home hub devices as yet, so cannot rate that part of it.

Very happy with this purchase!

The first couple of weeks we had problems with it hearing anything. We had to yell at it and it was getting old fast. We thought this was an upgrade from our 3rd gen but we were about to return it.

Got this for my lady as a Mother's Day present and I was very skeptical. Now I'm sold. This thing is off the chain just awesome.  the app has so many options to help customize it's just ridiculous.

This Echo 4th gen is awesome and the lady likes it too

Updating - now pretty much unusable. Doesn’t pick up our voice at allUpdating - over time, it has gotten worse. I talk directly to it,  but it never responds. All of the devices in the other rooms much further away answer. Even with an update, the microphone doesn’t work well.Updating my review to one less star. I have an Alexa in my kitchen, my living room (this one) , and my bedroom. Both are dots. You can be standing in the living room talking to the device over it, and the other Alexas respond to you. The microphone is awful. Thinking about returning. I stopped delivery on the 3 to order the 4 when it came out. Now, I wish I didn’t.My black device came with a horrible looking white aftermarket cord that is not Amazon original ; at least match the color.  It sounds ok; I have Alexa devices all around my house and compared to the dot, I think it’s honestly just ok. Not amazing.

So far so good!  I got the Echo to serve as my smart home hub. I’ve had a SmartThings hubs for a few years and have grown increasingly dissatisfied with it. I have been able to easily migrate all my smart bulbs to the Echo and the glitches are gone!  I have a couple z-wave outlets and some motion sensors that I can’tmove away from SmartThings yet but I’ll be working on solutions to that. I’m very satisfied with this Echo and all the other Alexa plugs, dots, spots and shows we’ve accumulated!

It has amazing sound, music sounds absolutely great!I got this for my adult Son who is autistic and totally blind so he can ask Alexa to play any type of music & any song that he wants to hear and hopefully this will encourages him to talk more. He loves to tell her good morning and good night. I think it will become very helpful for him. He just has to remember to say Alexa first. Also he can ask Alexa to make phone calls to family and for him this is awesome.

I am a  disabled woman confined to a power wheelchair most of my life. I live on a small fixed income. I have an older affordable flip cell phone. I received the Alexia as a Christmas gift. I was so thrilled until I discovered I need a phone with the ability of applications to use the Alexia. I looked at the prices of smartphones and they are far out of my price range. WHY, did you make Alexia work on applications? And WHY didn't you just build the application into the Alexia? Now I can't use it at all until I can afford to buy a smartphone. So angry with you, I just sat and cried when I found this out. It's always all about making as much money as possible, isn't it? So glad there are fewer days ahead of me than behind me. I will probably never get to use it. I have grown weary of this world of greedy money and power hungry people.

I got this at $30 off before Christmas.  I upgraded from my 2nd gen Echo.  The sound quality is better than a 2nd gen but not life alteringly better.  I actually like the new form factor. I purchased the limited edition red and it does look great.  If you are thinking about upgrading from a Dot I recommend it or if you find it on sale it's worth upgrading from a previous gen Echo.  I don't know if its worth a hundred beans to upgrade from a previous gen Echo.

I received this in the mail less than one hour ago.  After a simple set up, I cannot stop using it.  This is the most climate friendly, impressive speaker system I have ever had.  Long are the days of extra woofers, tweeters and standing speakers.  This orb packs a punch with incredible sound.  You need not spend another dime on expensive sound equipment.  Buy this, set it up in 2 minutes and play your favorite songs.  You will feel like you are in front of the artist.  The sound is like the Maxell commercial but better

Esta bien, es una buena compra para disponer de dispositivos IoT por primera vez, pero algunas veces cuando le hablo a Alexa no responde como esperaba. En la reproduccion de musica, si no pagas una cuenta premium de Spotify o Amazon Music, no esperes que va a reproducir con precisión la musica que a ti te gusta, porque no lo va a hacer. Despues comandos como el tiempo, la temperatura, monitorear otros dispositivos vinculados a Alexa, funciona perfectamente.

I am only writing this review with four stars because it is goofy to provide a white power supply with a charcoal unit. It just looks weird on the counter.

I love the sound!  I listen to waves for sleep and the sound is incredible! Sounds like I am laying on the beach! I also like the sphere shape over the previous towers. The only issue is information seems limited compared to GOOGLE assistant, meaning I can ask Alexa a question and she replies she doesn't know and then turn and ask my GOOGLE assistant the same question and get my desired answer 99.9% of the time. If you can get past that, it is a great device!

Much better than the first generation echo, sound and responsiveness wise. Didn't realize this new one has a way of gauging room temperature until I was f'ing around the alexa app to mess with one of the kids and I noticed it was telling me the temp in the room, a little inaccurate, though still a cool hidden feature. Don't regret the upgrade at all and may replace the other first gens soon as well.

I recently upgraded from the old, tall Alexa to this new 4th generation version.  I also got a new Echo Dot with clock.  I loved my old Alexa Echo and old Alexa Dot.  I am not so happy with these newer versions.  Perhaps it's the new shape, but it's clear that the new devices do not pick up on sound as well as the older versions did.  I have to constantly repeat ""Alexa"" to get their attention.  Is the new dome shame inhibiting them in some way?  And also very annoying is the fact that because the light is now at the bottom of the device, instead of at the top of a tower, it's not seen as easily.  So sometimes, Alexa may hear, but the light is not visible.  Why did you ruin a good thing?  The dome shape is not nearly as appealing and it doesn't do the job as well.  Very disappointing.

It’s a good smart component/driver with decent sound. Pretty incredible technology really, so I feel like a jerk complaining about anything, but I wish Alexa wouldn’t assume control of the volume, when I adjust the volume on the echo, or via voice/Alexa, I can no longer control the volume with my phone. I suppose it may be because I am using an iPhone.

At low volume levels this speaker is just average, a little tincanish even.  The sound is clear in the mid-range, but flat in the wings..  If there is an equalizer it is impossible to find.  Not nearly as good as the original Echo.  But, you need a hub, this is the only choice.  It also skips occasionally, WiFi connection was better on a Dot I had in the same location. The ball design makes the thing an accident waiting to roll off whatever surface. There should be a nesting ring to keep the goofy thing from rolling away.  It is impractical when handling, in that locating controls is mostly visual and not tactile.  Dust sticks to it.  On the plus side in a tiny room it is less disappointing.  In a open area, forget it.

We actually ended up buying 3 of these. Two for our 18 year olds for their rooms and one with a battery base so we can take it outside in the summer.  We already had 4 echos. Two of the old echo plus and two shows. Plus the echo auto for our cars.  We love controlling our lights with them since my wife is blind. We also use the drop in for friends and like an intercom in the house. The sound on these new ones is very good.

I bought one of these for my wife's office... the sound was soooo much better than my reg gen4 echo (that I also just bought for my office). So... I traded in a couple of older gen2 echo dots and bought this one for myself. I absolutely love it. It's about 3 or 4 times bigger than the regular dot but the sound is about 100X better with better low range (bass) sounds. This is the best speaker I have had (and I have had more than a few).

Do you enjoy manually turning the speaker in your direction every time you move around the room? Well, you'll be glad to hear that Amazon has an Echo for you! It only plays out of one side - revolutionary! Just pick it up whenever you move and turn the speaker in your direction!Seriously a terrible product, but when compared to Apple home pod.....it's still awful just not as awful as Apple home pod. Setting the bar high is not part of the strategy.  Which brings me to this:  if you want to play anything other than Amazon branded content - you will have to be prepared to battle the device constantly as it refuses to acknowledge that you have the default set to competitor subscriptions. Apple Music is Alexa's arch rival! She will do anything to keep you away from your music. She will try to shove Amazon music subscriptions down your throat even though you have Prime! (Hmmm- need to get rid of that then...).  I can deal with the poor sound quality but not frequent devious detours back to Amazon music as the default and having to reconnect my Apple account. I don't want to hear anymore reasons, I just want the games to stop!

I love the sound of this one. I was replacing a BlueTooth speaker that was connected to my Dot and this really provided the sound quality and volume I was looking for.It is big.

I had one of the original 'tower' type Alexa echo's.  The sound was good, the light ring was on the top and because it was tower shape... didn't take up too much space. This new one is, in my opinion, too big, too ugly and hard to see the light ring. And if you want the battery ability, you must buy an additional base which makes it even larger and more ugly.ALSO, apparently it doesn't seem to matter what color you buy, your power cord will be white. I bought a black echo and a white electric cord was enclosed.I am not a happy amazon camper.

I purchased this for more smart home capability, but definitely has much improved sound quality over Echo Dot.  I had bought some smart home switches that had said that they were Alexa compatible.

Cuando digo que tiene excelente sonido es por mucho mejor que los demas echo que tengo ya voy el 4to, ahora bien el micrófono no te escucha muy bien, hay que gritarle un poco mas para que funciones pero no para morirse, lo que si ha estado ocurriendo es que le cuesta aun integrarse con las demás Echo, segunda y tercera generación, pero tambien creo que hay que actualizarlas también

Won't even see bluetooth amplifiers or bluetooth devices outside of their Alexa Preset Profiles which aren't the same as the standard bluetooth.  I have a Samsung 5.1 surround system with a Samsung Bluetooth to Coax adapter that works with everything android, iphone, Windows computers even FireTVs but not the Echo's.  Same thing goes for my Fosi Amplifier w Bluetooth that I purchased on Amazon. Everything works with it except the Echos's. This renders my Echo's and my Amazon Music Account USELESS!  Either fix your bluetooth problem or give us all back our money and then you can cancel my amazon music account! A month is long enough to fix the bluetooth problem! It feels like there is no intention of fixing it now!

Short answer: it is a functional smart speaker, but the sound is terrible.Long answer: it has more sound and bass than the echo dot, but the bass cracks and the treble is muddy. You might be better off with a dot than the sound from this speaker. If you are buying this instead of the dot going for better sound, don't! You are better off purchasing a JBL flip 4 and hooking up a dot to it.

I had gen 1,3 and some other.long story short: this is not better, just more expensive. Save your money. Go for the previous  gen. Half the price and pick up our voices before this one does....I DO NOT RECOMMEND!- doesnt recognize / hear well (no better than gen 1 and 3 if not worse)- microphone seems even more directional... an issue since we place it in the middle but unless you talk AT it or yell... well you just have to yell- sound quality is not great. I dont use alexa for music and I surely will not with this thing (dont listen the reviews of pcmag etc... bs... this thing is terrible)- WHITE cable? For a black alexa? Why?... so it sticks out?- the ball shape - it is not good looking and it makes the thing stick out even more when i need it to melt in the background. Let’s face it: it s not a piece of art so the quieter it is visually, the better.Bottom line is it s not an upgrade. It’s the same product as before, more expensive, uglier. We are disappointed they haven’t improved the microphone.If you don’t have one, the cheaper one is the way to go. If you have one... don’t upgrade - amazon does NOT offer such a thing. Just taking your money.

The best thing about this echo is the sound quality. I am a bit of an audiophile so good sound quality is important for listening to music and this is one of the best single speakers I’ve owned in several years with a better bass register than other Any other Bluetooth or smart speakers I’ve owned. This device also works well for us with good voice recognition.

The unit doesn't seem to like my wife's voice.  It ignores her.  I have no problem but with the Gen 4 (I have an Echo and Echo Dot) I sometimes have to say 'Alexia' twice to get it's attention.

At this point I wish I ordered 2, up stairs and downstairs, more boom for your money.. Yes you read it correctly.

This certainly sounds better than the older generation Echo Dot that we replaced. But the Dot almost never disconnected from the Internet and this unit disconnects very frequently. When it's working it's great, but I'm not sure the new generation is an improvement. Could be a fluke, and I still like it overall, but it is the most finicky Echo we own.

Heavy on the bass with next to no treble.  The mic, as with all Echo devices are horrible.  The noise cancelation and ability to block its own sound are laughable.Edit 5/30/2021: I got a call within 8 minutes of posting this review. I was shocked but it was customer service to address my concerns. That level of Customer Care is unheard of and for that reason alone I would recommend using the Alexa devices. As for their tips; they showed me my area of lack of knowledge and how to correct it. In the app you can adjust the Bass, Mid, and Treble I didn't know that. Having made this changes the sound is far better. For the mic they had me remove and resync the devices. This shad had a somewhat positive result but it is still to early to be 100% sure. I would say accuracy has gone up 50% but still not fully there. I hope this can be figured out further with software updates. I will update this again in a few months to see if it has changed. For now I highly recommend the devices for the interface, flexibility, sound, price, and the absolute boss level Customer Care. Mic still needs work but it is minor at this point compared to all the other things.

Not sure why anyone would give this a low rating. It’s far better than the old versions. It actually sounds amazing. I like the fact that they are continuing to improve upon the product. The older version sounds like crap compared to this product. The newer version actually has bass to it. Unlike the little flat button design that sounds like a cell phone speaker. The 5 pay option is also great!

I'm comparing against a Gen 1 Echo and 2 Gen 1 Dots which I've had since they first hit the market. My Gen 4 device was defective: both hard of hearing (my Gen 1 Dot 30' away in another room would hear me and with this device I had to yell to get it to activate) and the speaking voice sounded muffled compared to my other devices. Other dislikes: I ordered a black Echo but it came with a white cable. It's a minor point but I think a black cable would be more appropriate. Worse however was that the cable is ridiculously short (compared to all my Gen 1 devices) which limits placement without the need for an extension cord. Overall, fairly disappointed and returned. HOWEVER, aside from the cord color and length which would have still resulted in my returning the device, I'm hoping that my ""operationally defective device"" was an anomaly and I just got a bad one. Overall, my wife and I enjoy the conveniences Alexa adds to our smart home and this poor review shouldn't deter you from trying out Alexa if you never have. The 4th Gen Echo did not work for me, so I instead purchased a 3rd Gen Dot; it is my 4th Alexa device.

I have had mine for about a year now.  I call customer service at least every 3rd month.  When you ask when someone was born who is famous, be sure you have the name exact and pronounce it correctly.  Otherwise you get someone else.  When you ask about an actor to find out how old they are you don't always get the right person.  You must know exactly what their full name is to hopefully get the right person. Setting routines up most of the time you need customer service to walk you through.  What seem logical is not. I have decided to give it one more year and if they do not improve getting information from it, I will give it to Goodwill and let someone else have the heard ache.  NOT a real stable device to live with. If you are a very young person and like a lot of silly things then this is the device for you. I usually ask this device first for info and then I have to go to another program on my phone to find the right answer. Think about this before you buy!!!

I own the original Echo and love it. The new model is a disappointment. First, I find the sound quality to be lacking, worse than the 1st edition. It is pretty fuzzy and is really distorted at higher volumes.Also the new Echo does not include a remote. This wouldn't be a problem if the voice recognition worked better. As it is I find myself screaming at the darn thing to get it to respond. I have driven myself crazy  trying to sync the two devices to play at the same time. They never play the same thing together, and half the time one plays while the other talks about something unrelated to the request. They occasionally get the fire-tv stick in on the action, just for fun. I still haven't figured it out.I have the original Echo in my living room and the new Echo in the bedroom. They are a full room and hallway apart from one another. If I am on the couch the Echo in the bedroom responds and if I am in the  bedroom standing right next to the new Echo, the one in the living room responds. This is ridiculously annoying.I'm actually annoyed with myself for getting so annoyed by what is essentially a first world problem. Arghh.  ""Alexa, play the meditation station.""

I have three Echo V3 and now the new Echo V4. I find that the Echo 4 sounds not much better but can be louder and is comparably a bit deaf. Also both versions (as well as the Echo Dot) have extremely low signal level on the auxiliary output making connection to a powered speaker or a stereo receiver difficult without some intermediate gain device. As to being deaf, the Echo 4 requires that one must be very close (4-5 feet) or to yell in order for Alexa to receive commands. Also, there is no remote available for Echo 4. The Echo V3 has no such issues and easily understands commands from a reasonable distance (across the room) using a moderate voice level.I have relegated my Echo 4 to a small room and brought back the Echo 3 to the kitchen where I use it most, sometimes with the remote when others are conversing in the room.

I purchased 4 of these units to replace 2nd generation dots in various parts of the house. They arrived, and after setup I have noted that the new Echos are slower to respond and be ready to accept commands than the original Dots.If you say ""Alexa"" the original dot is ready within about a second to be listening, but the new units are two to three seconds slower to even begin listening so now instead of saying ""Alexa what is the weather today"" you have to say,""Alexa........"" go have a coffee, twiddle thumbs,""..................what is the weather today."" They are also definitely slower than the google home units. This appears to have been a big step backwards in regards to speed. But that could also be because of the new AZ1 chips in them.But, with that said, the sound quality is a lot better than the old unit, doesn't make up for the lags in responses, but it does make for a better music streaming experience.

I needed a hub to connect a Philips motion sensor using the “Zigbee” standard to a smart bulb. Amazon says this has a “built-in Zigbee smart home hub” and allows you to “Easily set up compatible Zigbee devices,” but it does not connect to Philips Zigbee motion sensors. A separate Philips bridge is required for those. This misled into buying the Echo when I did not need it.

This would be my favorite Alexa except that I had gotten another Echo Dot 4th generation at the same time which arrived first.

Amazon and Ring advertise the Echo 4th gen as replacing a Ring Bridge. Well, it doesn't. That is clear if you read the many reviews here talking about it.

Solid sound in a compact device. Audio quality is pretty good, they pair easily and there’s no gap between playbacks. I will say that every device I’ve had so far has glitched out within days of getting it. And there’s not really any way to stop it without just unplugging. I do very much so dislike that there’s no way to silence a device without it being drenched in neon red lights the entire time. Maybe even like an intermittent pulse of red every now and then would be immensely better.

Had the echo for guess going on 6 months.  Was great to begin with.  Sound is decent and really only thing i use it for is controlling lights.  For the past month or so though the damn ring light will come on white and just spin all the time.  I chatted with  customer service a couple weeks ago and their fix was to uninstall the app on my phone then unplug and plug back in the echo.  So that fixed it while chatting.  Two days later started doing it again and now some days it goes 24 - 48 hours straight.  The echo dot in my bedroom did it once at night.  So getting to the point to unplug them both and see what my options are from there.  Very frustrating!!!  I did the remove the app and reboot them again one evening and again that fixed it for like a day.

The only problem I have found so far, is that the music stops playing after about 30minutes. I use the music mostly, so for me that is a bit of a drag. Otherwise, the unit is wonderful to have.

So i lost my connector for my smart lights and my friend said hey alexa works with them regardless So i was all for it... Until i received it and wow... sound quality is wonky set it to 10 talks really loud but that's it, alarms will be quiet music eh and the quality of the music is subpar.. so yeah.  Now Voice recognition is dumb it'll just randomly activate for no reason no prompting no one saying anything close to ALEXA nothing... now some of the apps are kinda cool for it but not worth.. most of them you have to buy which is dumb and just greedy and then ask it anything and it'll say ""I do not know that"" or something similar i could ask my Google home ANYTHING and it would try to answer me... i could ask it to convert 62.23 USD to CAN and it would no problems but ask Alexa ""I do not know that"" i could ask google home ANYTHING and i would get an answer and yeah some of the more Vague ones with google would get me some randomish or not exactly what i wanted but atleast it would try and would get something close instead of a big Pile of Nothing... i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this period, especially over a google home or even a google home mini

The sound of this speaker is great but if you plan on using 2 or more of them in parallel, go with something else.  I purchased 2 of the echo 4th gen speakers and in 2 different homes(on 2 different internet/wifi systems) they would regularly cut out at least every other song.  As such I bought 2 of the new echo dots, and have them bluetoothed to much better speakers and have save >$100.  Sadly, with the 2 brand new echo dots, I am still getting the cut out and at times static but only when I am playing the music over multiple dots.  The echo 4th gen speakers are being returned as the cost does not justify the music regularly cutting out.  I'm sure that at some point they will figure out how to run multiple echo speakers/dots without the music cutting out or high levels of static, but until then I am going to cut my losses.

El reconocimiento de voz es perfecto y la calidad del sonido es excelente. Funciona muy bien en español, pero todavía hay cosas que tienen que trabajar. Me encanta la función multilingüe, que me permite usar a Alexa tanto en español como en inglés, aunque me gustaría que pudieran ser más de dos idiomas.Por cierto, Aunque estoy reseñando un producto de Amazon en Amazon, la compra del Echo fue por eBay, porque Amazon no envía este producto a Puerto Rico, estaría bien que resolvieran eso.

Had for a few months now. Sound quality isn't much different than the original echo we had, and at least the original one worked every time until it broke. This one doesn't respond half the time, and when it does respond sometimes it says it doesn't know what you're talking about, and other times it just makes that annoying ""bong"" sound and does nothing. This is during something as simple as turning on lights or asking it to shuffle songs. Wouldn't buy again and starting to look at other smart speakers.

Premium sound, super fast response times, terrific looking, wonderful with rechargeable battery base (sold separately) to make it portable. I can't say enough good things.

The Echo has much better speaker quality than the dots.  On a scale of 1-10, I would give this speaker a sound quality of a 6 or 7.  Great for the price.  Nice to have these all over the house so music can be heard wherever I go.  Sometimes I have to get her attention more than once to accomplish a task, but I guess that's the hazards.

So far we love everything about it. The only surprise was it's size. We were picturing a softball size...and this one is more like a grapefruit.

Of all my Echo speakers, I'm most disappointed with this one.  I should've just purchased a second 3rd gen.The 4th gen's sound doesn't carry as far.  It won't pair with my Echo remote.  It doesn't want to pair with anything via Bluetooth.My two biggest complaints are the reaction time and dropped connection.I have my Echo 4th gen is by far the slowest to light-up when I say ""Alexa.""  My 1st gen is faster.When playing music everywhere, the speaker will sometimes stop playing.  The rest of my echo devices throughout the house will continue to play, but the 4th gen will drop out, even though it's still connected to WiFi.  I found that if I just wait, it'll start playing again, but only for a few seconds, and then it'll prematurely force the system to skip to the next song.What I do like... I guess the fabric cover is nice.

I bought this strictly to listen to music.  I love the sound of the echo 4th generation and the fact that I can use Alexa with it.  What I don't like is that it doesn't have a good holder to sit on.

Very pleased with the aesthetics and sound from this. I got this to replace my seldom working WINK hub. The only downside (not the fault of Alexa) is the need for an additional bridge for Lutron smart switches. I opted to replace all of my Lutron switches instead of paying for another proprietary hub. You can see my review of the TreatLife switches that I replaced Lutron with. Spoiler alert, I love how simple those switches were installed and then detected by this Hub.

I had a 1st Gen Alexa. She was tall, elegant, and dare I say graceful. But as all things do, she died. I think her carcass is around here somewhere. This new Alexa came and she's pretty - one big bubble. But her voice recognition skills are terrible. If I'm playing the Jeopardy app I had to have meditated ahead of time in order to have the patience for the 18 times it craps out during the game. I miss Alex Trebek, but it makes me want to kill him. When she eventually comes down off her high horse long enough to play music, she's very fickle about what she'll play. She'll play Billy Joel, but don't even think about asking her to play music from Encanto. She'll make you feel dumb for wasting her time by asking.Do yourself a favor and take care of your 1st or 2nd Gen Echo. They're a rare breed and deserve all the love, care, and attention you can give them.

 I bought the (product)red to support the mission. As far as the Echo products goes, I am always impressed by its quality and reliability. Great improvement with the sound! I love the deep bass and it's the loudest Echo device to date!!!The only down vote I have is the power adapter. It's white and tends to attract a lot of dirt. I wished it was the standard black. Other than that you would definitely enjoy using this Echo.

I was about to order another Echo but after the forced update on Nov. 1, 2022 I have lost interest. The new Prime music has a forced shuffle button that can't be turned off. I used to be able to listen to all the music by a particular artist. Now it will play that ONE song and then shuffle music by ""similar artists"". This forces me to listen to music I don't like. It is now no different than a radio. I won't buy another and I think people should know it has changed drastically from what it was.
","Negative"
"
1-year update and I have to say that this product is very inconsistent.  I mostly use this for listening to music.  Some days it will play perfect for hours.  Then the next day I can't get it to play a whole song without cutting out.  Unplug, restart, and it does it more.  Then Alexa doesn't respond correctly to audio commands.  I'm just about done with this junk.  It's an audio speaker and it can barely do that on it's best day.  Pair the subwoofer with it and multiply your headaches!!!  Sometimes it works, other times it don't... and then on the rare occasion, the SUBWOOFER will play music when the speaker won't.  VERY annoying!!!
","Negative"

I really love the new form factor! The upgraded sound quality is astonishing compared to the previous versions. However I find myself and every person in my household having to repeat wake ups and instructions over and over.. the good thing is there is a good overlap in my house with multiple devices. This one is the central device and rarely takes the command before another device calls back. Other than that it’s great. I think I will just move it to the garage and bring the old one back in.
","Positive"
"
I had two of the original Alexas, the tall ones. One still worked great, the other one kept stopping for no reason so I thought I would update. Big mistake.  First of all, I don't like the blue ring being on the bottom, I can't always see it so I don't know if Alexa is responding. 2nd of all, I hate the volume button. It also does not go as loud as my other Alexa. I do not notice any improvement in the sound quality. I also don't think Alexa responds as well as the taller one. The only advantage is the pause button, so I can put Alexa to sleep while my 3 yo grandson is visiting so he'll stop yelling at her to do things. I should have known newer does not always make for better. I bought the larger echo and the smaller echo, for a smaller area upstairs. Disappointed with both.

Pandora/Alexa integration is ridiculously cool but not entirely complete - Alexa will only be able to access the first 20 Pandora stations in your collection not the complete list. Work around - Tell your Echo to connect to your device with Pandora on it, in my case an iPhone 12 mini, do NOT launch the Alexa app on your device, then launch Pandora to have full control, select your Echo to cast to, and done - complete direct control of Pandora.

While I wouldn't replace our home theater system with this, the sound quality is REALLY good.  For us that was a side benefit.  Our smart home controller had been down for some days (the company's viability is in question now) and through some research I learned that this level of Echo had some of the capability to fill that void.  Win/win for us as we have at least one of the Alexa products in every room of the house.

I love my echo. Combined with a couple of smart plugs I can control my living room lamp and bedroom lamp. I listen to any genre of music I want by simply saying Alexa play 70's music or whatever genre I want, also I can play any song or any artist,just by asking Alexa. The sound quality is good enough. I keep a running grocery list and general shopping list, also a to do list. Really the sky is the limit.

I really enjoy voice recognition.  Not having to grab your phone to change music or turn it up is great.

Up until this year, all I ever had was a second generation Echo Dot. It has been only recently I have become interested in the power of Echo. I do like this unit, especially the sound.

Changing review from 5 to 1. Great sounding speaker and easy to use, but now I don't have much use for it.I invested in FIVE of these, never dreaming Amazon would drastically change Prime Music. Now I can't even specify music by a single artist or group, and when it plays music I didn't request, I'm only allowed to skip a few songs per hour. I'd never have invested in this platform is I had known Amazon Music would become worthless, only playing what it wants to play, not what I want to hear.

If there could be a volume for when she speaks and one for the music they play that would solve things.

Two Echo 4's were an easy and relatively inexpensive fix to poor sound quality on my TV.  They're connected to a Fire Stick 4K using wifi and the Alexa app.  The result is a nice quality stereo sound system that can be controlled by the firestick remote, cell phone, or by voice.  I'll be adding the Echo subwoofer soon which should make an already good setup better.

I live alone and bought a couple of her light bulbs and find find asking either Alexa or Dot (sorry they don’t include the word Dot in the list of wake words...so I wake the diminutive one Echo until Amazon adds Dot) very convenient. Will probably add other accessories.  Sadly, neither has the ability to fold the laundry but have very cute quips when asked.

While I like the look, the sound, it knew who I was. It turned on/off the lights, the struggle was to plug in the short cord. I had to stack stuff to get the outlet high enough. The cord for the alexa this replaces was long enough and then some. I don't think a reasonable length cord is something I should have to pay extra for.

I placed this speaker in the center of our open 2000 sq foot basement where we take family entertainment in the cold months and can sustain social distance. The speaker has enough power to fill the space, good sound, strong base, and Alexa means anyone can take on the, ""What do you want to hear next?"" role. This is the second one I bought and as price breaks and bundle deals come up, it will likely not be the last.

I think that for the money the sound quality is great! It delivers good bass in my opinion, and good highs and kids. Both podcasts and music sound great, even over a running shower I can hear everything clearly on around 60% volume. Alexa is another amazing feature, perfect to control my smart home devices and just get general information as well as play music and podcasts without moving your hands. Very very nice for an average person who's not expecting god-tier audio from a $70-100 Amazon device.

This has been the best product I have bought for my home. Ever. Sound quality is wonderful. I use it for sleep sounds, reminders, alarms, playing music, asking it questions, and better organIzing my life. I love telling the app on my phone to remind me of something when I get home. I also use it to manage my home lighting, water heater and more. It is easy to use and my 9 year old loves using it too.

I upgraded from a generation one echo and not only does this look way better the sound is substantially improved. I never used my old echo for music and although this doesn’t replace a stereo, the sound is definitely passable for short listening times. For longer periods I still will probably use my UE Boom or JBL, but for a couple of songs or just some background music, the new echo is comparable. And with the trade in discount for my old echo, this is a no brainer.

I don’t ever do reviews but this thing is amazing. Amazon definitely outdid themselves I have a 250$ Sony speaker that blew out and this I got for 40$ during that huge sale my god it sounds amazing just a heads up you don’t need a few of these I love in a two story house and I hear it just fine everywhere! But I’ll definitely get a smaller one for the bathroom definitely have a new echo customer.

I bought this for my brother, who is blind and completely bedridden. It's a great product...he uses it to call my cell phone, all the music he wants, weather and calendar information. It has taken the place of his old talking watch, talking thermometer, radio and his cell phone, all of which he can no longer operate.  It's really his link to the world outside his nursing home room.

The sound is only a wee bit better than the previous model. However, the light ring at the base of the orb is far too bright and too large. There is no way to disable this unnecessary light ring. I buy speakers to listen to them not to watch them. I rate this product a fail for the inability of users to disable the light ring.The light ring feature on the new Echo 4th gen is a complete failure. It is too large. It is too bright. When I mute the microphone it glows bright red for no good reason since the microphone button is also glowing red. The designers of the device failed. I should be able to turn  off the light ring completely. But I can't even adjust its brightness. I can't use this device where I wanted since it always calls too much visual attention to itself. I don't need a light ring. My Google Nest Audio Speaker, which costs about the same as the Echo 4th generation, does not call unwarranted attention to itself, like the Amazon device.The Echo worthless to me and I expect to return it and replace it with another Google Nest Audio Speaker. I prefer the functionality of Alexa and the Alexa app over Google Assistant but the physical speaker's appearance and sound matter more than all the wiz-bang features of either system.

I upgraded from an Echo 1st gen device. I definitely like the appearance of this one better. I like the white color and shape; it is less ""obtrusive"" looking.

Very disappointed in this investment. The “premium” sound quality seems the same as the 3rd gen echo I have in the other room. Plus the echo flex in the bathroom hears me before this one that’s 12’ away! Wasn’t even worth the sale price, in my opinion! Perhaps it’s faulty, I don’t know. But I’m sick and tired of having return purchases from Amazon so often!

Love this echo!! The sound quality is amazing!! I love the different features. We use this one as our main hub for the kitchen/living area for music, iRobot (release the kraken!! Seriously if you have one, try it!) because of the great sound. We have the echo dots in the other rooms of the house. These still have good sound quality, but are smaller and better suited for bedrooms.

The echo fourth generation seems like a fine product sensitivity the voice is not quite as good as the second generation echo but still very good. It should be possible to hook up the echo with two dots for the stereo affect in pairing it with the Amazon cube at present I believe you can only hook up to speakers when using the Amazon site but you should be able to add additional speakers just as you can when you playing music.

I just got this but I've had Echo before.  Very happy with this purchase.  Sounds quality is great.  I think the new round design is actually very nice looking.  Not sure about the front only speaker versus the 360 speaker but I am very happy so far.  I especially love my red color as it goes with my decor so very well.  Want to add the battery but only available in black or white so I will probably get the white.

I was given an Echo/Alexa 4th Generation as a Christmas gift. The sound had a intermittent static issue. Amazon replaced it immediately. The replacement works perfectly. I have the Echo 1st Generation, 2nd , 3rd plus an Echo 3rd Generation Dot including battery bases for most. The sound quality including the bass on the 4th Generation is superior to the previous generations. I bought a second 4th Generation to set up a stereo speaker group, which includes a Echo Sub.

Love this speaker for its versatility involving Alexa and its sound quality will amaze you.. Very clear and full of bass. Amazing!

I’ve read some of the reviews here about the new look and I have to say I love it! It’s nice to change things up. It feels like a nice modern flow. The sound is better than the last model, especially the bass. This is my third edition and I think Amazon did a great job!

I really liked my gen 2 echo. This new one does not sound as nice. Doesn’t look as nice. It has a white cord that does not match, and Alexa turns up the volume when I say “Alexa turn off”. I’ll play with the EQ more but the Gen 2 sounded great out of the box. Lights on the bottom are also annoying.

We love the Echo. We bought 2 on Prime Day and saved some money. We're not audiophiles, we just know what sounds good. The Echo has a superior and full range. Only complaint is the cord being white. The missus would prefer black, to match countertops. Life ain't fair!  Next we'll buy the battery base so we can take it out to the firepit without cord.

I was weary of ""migrating"" from Cortana to Alexa, but the process has been seamless, and I am very happy with the Echo 4. The audio is actually better than the Harman Kardon Evoke I was using, and I will most likely get 2 Echo Dots for where I don't play music but for the automation of lights etc.
","Positive"

The new Echo G4 sounds good, a nice bass and treble combo. It's recognizing my voice over the sound produced from the speaker system is poor and voice recognition ( my voice print) is weak. The Alexa G2 is still my favorite and after 3 to 4 years of use it sounds great. The everywhere mode is a great tool.

The sound quality of this device is actually better than I expected. It reproduces lows better than should be possible in such a small device. Voice recognition is good, but if it’s playing music at a moderately high volume, I have to raise my voice significantly to get a response. I was able to easily connect it to a smart dimmer I have on the patio lights, so I can turn them on/off, and dim them without leaving my chair.

They do seem to disconnect from each other sometimes and only one will play.  The other issue I have is that I will ask it to play something, it will acknowledge bit then nothing happens.  I check the wifi and I still have 50 MB down so I don't think that is it.  I am not a big fan of the round format but I have to say the two of these in stereo blows away the sound of my Echo Studio

Look no further! I got rid & sold my Amazon 3rd generation after using the 4th generation for a couple days. The 3rd generation is great if you want to save money but overall, if you want to spend and invest in better sound quality, better voice recognition, better everything, better look and modern feel, I would buy the 4th generation. It’s absolutely perfect. It is clear, concise, loud, and amazing. I like the 4th generation so much. Don’t think about it, just get it!!! :)

When I ordered this I did not realize what I was getting. I test drove Alexa using my friends Dot unit and I liked it but wanted a unit with better sound capabilities.

I would definitely recommend this product. Have fun.

I’ve had the original Alexa for about 6 years now and I wanted an upgrade. I purchased this speaker thinking it would be better in sound quality but I was disappointed. The sound quality is sub par and it does not turn up very loud if you like to blast your music like I do while cleaning, cooking or taking a shower. The main reason why I returned my purchase is because it just stopped connecting to my WiFi. No matter what I tried, it would not connect. There were a few other annoying glitches that I dealt with that I never had happen with the original speaker. The thing that I did enjoy was the color changing light bulb that came with it. Other than that, I’ll just continue using my old speaker. It actually connects and sounds better than the newer version.

Have used these around the shop in the past so the crew can play whatever music they like in their area. Latest versions are pretty worthless in both Dot and normal Echo sizes.

It can’t hear you when the tv is on.  It says it has adaptive volume, I’ve heard no evidence that this is true.  I ask it to change volume and it periodically tells me “that feature is not supported”.  I don’t understand why the reminders volume is not set by the alarm volume.  Reminders whisper and alarms sound fine.  My echo dot seems to be far more reliable than the echo.

Sound quality is great and is an upgrade from the echo dot (smaller model). This is more suited for a bigger room like a living room/common area. Voice recognition of these 4th gen models are notorious for the voice recognition being worse than previous models. This is this only issue I can see with this model!

We have multiple Alexis enabled devices pretty much one for each room and when you ask one to play something more often than not another device will start playing it in a different room, having multiple lexuses in one room the wrong one will respond, Google assistance is are much better at voice recognition and more prompt and responses, Alexa feels like you're talking to a 5-year-old and Google feels like you're talking to a teenager

I've been a big fan of the Echo family since it was introduced. This version have me a bit of a start when I first viewed its shape. I like that the volume buttons are easier to view and locate.

Good voice recognition and appropriate Alexa responses.

I’m glad I didn’t listen to the earlier reviews. I like the new shape. Easily lends itself to any room decor. The sound quality is SUPERB!! Some reviewers said the sound was too bassy or boom-like, then make adjustments. Just like you did for the previous model. The light ring at the bottom adds to the new look.

I feel bamboozled. I have owned every Echo/Echo+, and every time it has gotten progressively better. I’ve really enjoyed watching a well-made product get better and better with no major downsides for years. I actually look forward to buying the new generation each time.So I’m really, really disappointed with this fourth generation. Its smaller form factor means its microphone is physically located much closer to its base, so if you had your Echo+ on a side table (like me), expect your experience to take a serious nosedive. I repeat myself four or five times, getting louder each time sometimes. I have an echo dot in the next room and about 25% of the time IT picks up before the Echo 4th gen does.An overall downgrade, unfortunately. Making devices smaller is not always an improvement. Maybe the mics are placed in worse locations, I don’t pretend to know.

My goodness. This thing is a pain in the butt. I bought this to replace my 3rd gen echo. First thing I noticed is the mic barely hears me. My 3rd gen echo hears me loud and clear even when music is blasting I've whispered to it to test it and it heard me fine, but this 4th gen needs to be yelled at 98% of the time I'm less than a foot away from it. Second, I noticed when I played my playlist it had songs missing, so it tells me if I want the missing songs back I have to upgrade to amazon music unlimited for $7.99 a month which makes no sense cause I'm doing amazon music unlimited for  $2.99 a month already. I plugged my 3rd gen back in and the songs on my playlist all came back free of charge and were all there. So I plug my 4th gen back in hoping somehow the issue fixed itself and it's back to telling me I need to pay $7.99 a month again. Seriously? What's wrong with this dysfunctional product? I might return it if it's gonna keep acting like a cheap pile of garbage like this. And as for the sound quality, I honestly can barely tell the difference between it and my 3rd gen.

This 4th generation echo has a great sound and performs vert well. Previously we had an echo show 5 and it was a piece of junk. Sound recognition is not perfect but performs well - background noise seems to be the biggest problem with that feature. I recommend getting the charging base which also allows you to disconnect from the adapter up to 5 hours. Overall well worth the money.

I enjoy the sound from this echo 4. I have my fire stick streaming through this speaker. My only issue is that sometimes I loose the sound. I am still not sure if it is a echo problem or a fire stick issue. The chances are is it is a echo issue. I have had to repair both my echos as well as restarting my fire stick in order to troubleshoot and resolve. The sound it provides are worth these minor bugs.

After owning an echo dot for years, we decided it was time for an upgrade.  Our daughter and son-in-law gave us our echo 4th generation and we absolutely love it!  Simple to set up and easy to use. The sound is of very good quality and now we're using it instead of our old radio. Alexa answers our questions and gives us advice when we ask for it. We are so satisfied that we are getting another one for downstairs!

Overall a better Echo experience for the most part. I think it sounds better and louder. Compared to the Echo gen 1. Though sometimes it doesn’t hear me at all.  I am unable to use the internal temperature sensor in routines.  You can not pair an Echo Remote with it.

I have a lot of Echo devices around the house.  I bought this one to start to try out the built-in 'smart home hub' functionality to see if it could replace some of the more complex home automation devices we have in our home.  So far, the answer is 'no'.  I started simple, testing with a couple of Zigbee lightbulbs I already had. The web page for the Gen4 echo says it supports both of the two bulbs I had (from different mfgs).  It will not discover either of them in a lamp only about 8' away from the Echo.  Both are discoverable from another hub device.  I very much like the idea of using an Echo device as my smart home hub -- but I don't hink this particular device is ready for prime time yet.

As a speaker, it's good. Sounds nice. Understands me well. And can be helpful with many tasks and reminders, but what ruins it for me is Amazon uses it unapologetically to constantly advertise and make sales. It is intrusive.For instance, ask it for the weather and after giving you a response, it says, ""By the way, I can now recommend gift ideas. Would you like to hear one now?""Seriously?! Who thought that I would need a smart speaker that spends it's time trying to convince me to buy more crap. How is that going to make life better?I've turned all the settings off for advertising, but it ignored it in this case as it doesn't think that gift ideas is another form of advertising. If this continues, I will be selling all of my Amazon stuff and dumping them altogether.I don't need a billboard in my house. Maybe I'll try Google smart speakers instead.

It claims I can add other speakers to it and have surround sound in my entire house.  So I followed the instructions to get my existing Bose speakers added as devices, than created the groups.  It will play one of the Bose speakers, tried the other but failed to connect, and doesn't play itself when it plays the one Bose speaker it does play.  I want all three speakers (including the Echo) playing the same thing in synch, controlled by Alexa.  When I tried to get Alexa to do it she asks for a speaker to group, I say ""SoundTouch"" and she says she can't find ""SoundTouch"" then searches and says ""I found SoundTouch, should I add that speaker?""  Duh, that's what I asked for.

I have a small assisted living facility, after buying and echo for my mother for Christmas, I realized all that could be done with the devices. I then purchased a base unit and one satellite for every resident in the facility.

The uses are endless, best purchase I have made in years.

Improved now with  stereo pair. Good for back round non serious listening.  Inferior to reference stereo dual 60 watt amplifier with pair of $300 smallish floor speakers =  that directly play phono, FM and CD.

I am not an audiophile by any-means, but if you get 2 of these and pair them in stereo in a average sized room they sound as good as speakers that cost 4 times as much. The Alexa smart hub works great and allows tons of options that works with many other IoT devices. The physical mic off button is  a awesome feature. If you are looking for a decent audio based hub these are well worth the added cost over the earlier gen Echos.

Love the sound quality of the Echo with premium sound. It did freeze quite a bit the first time I used it. I had asked it to play music “everywhere” and it wouldn’t. Had to restart it a couple of times (unplugged it and plugged it back in) for it to do what I said. Haven’t had any issues since though. Hoping it stays that way.

Initial setup was a breeze.  But failed multiple times when trying to get it to join existing Alexa groups already in the house, because it was 'unrecognized network'.  Only way to have all the Echo speaker groups to integrate was to reset router (Nighthawk Mesh) to factory settings and rebuild the entire house network of wi-fi devices using new network name and password, which took alot of time.

I had an Echo for many years, and it met it's unfortunate demise during Hurricane Sally last September. I was oh so sad, and tried to resuscitate her to no avail. I ordered this new model and of course it works just like my old Alexa. I just love them for making lists, and listening to music, and asking google type questions.

So, we’ve had the 4th gen for a year and a half. I understand the updated echo can hear you over loud music, however, the echo still fails to understand word & names when we request songs. It’s so bad that we have to walk over to the echo to repeat ourselves. Sometimes I have to spell words and names. Can’t wait for the newest addition, or for a sale on an older edition.

It was easy to set up. I was replacing an older Echo hub. I did not need to set up any other devices to recognize the new hub. Sound quality is better than the 2nd gen. Voice recognition seems about the same which was already very good. Overall very happy with it so far.

I was tired of waking up to a beeping alarm and always hitting snooze so many times that I was frequently getting to work later than I wanted. So, as a solution, I bought an Amazon Echo to one simple task: wake me up to what is essentially a commercial-free radio of my own music library. Alexa doesn't even have the capability to do that! If I pick a playlist to wake me up, it ALWAYS starts with the first song on the playlist, and it ALWAYS starts with shuffle mode turned off. I've tried asking it to shuffle my playlist when setting my alarm, leaving Spotify on shuffle the night before, and asking Alexa to turn shuffle mode on the night before, but none of them work--it wakes me up with shuffle off. Why is this simple wish so difficult to fulfill? I couldn't find an iPhone app that does this, which is why I bought an Echo. Alas, it appears software that can execute this very basic concept still has not been sufficiently developed for iPhone users. I am jealous of the Android users that have Google clock.

The selection of music is endless. The information you can collect in a second or two is amazing. My only (small) complaint is that I sometimes have to shout for the unit to respond.

Por otra parte no ocupa espacio, el tamaño es considerable y el peso todavía mejor, ya que no pesa casi nada.

Two weeks ago I purchased two 4th gen echo dots.  They're fine for basic stuff but sound quality was only OK.  Today I received a full sized Echo and I am astounded by the huge leap in sound quality.  I can't understand some of the reviews on here that criticize the sound.  This thing sounds absolutely BEAUTIFUL!  I did not want to spend this much money but I am super pleased with this purchase.

It is very helpful for every day reminders that just pop up. Just tell Alexa to remind you she ask you about what and when.....Excellent for remembering meetings or meds at a certain time........The to do list function needs to be more user friendly.

Well to be honest, i'm nt happy with my Echo 4th generation as i bought it because my old echo stopped working, so i bought this be i needed to all the questions, but it will not control my lights or anything elsecause it has a built in hub that's what i needed,well it responds.Eeally need help with it.

This is replacing an old 2nd generation and doesn't seem like much of an upgrade except the built in hub.Phillip's Hue LEDs were easy to set up and configure, and we feel like we rewired some unusable hanging kitchen bar lights for the perfect brightness for free.I know there are a lot of other enhancements but just solving our lighting problem makes us very happy with the upgrade.

Traded a First Gen unit in for this 4th gen in order to get Zigbee support (replacing Wink).

I bought this to replace a 1st generation Echo Dot.  The improvement in sound quality is amazing.  Also Alexa responds much better now.  With the old Dot, I sometimes had to say ""Alexa"" a few times before she would wake up.  The microphone on this new Echo is awesome.  I am very happy with this Echo.

We replaced a couple order Alexa units with these because they were supposed to have much better sound.  They sort of due.  They have much better directional sound, but don't fill a space/room as well as the older non-directional units.THe biggest annoyance is these are much worse at voice recognition, they are always struggling to hear us, and when they do hear us they frequently mistake the command.  These are in the exact same locations as our old units that worked great.

The new echo struggles on the voice recognition. I have to repeat myself multiple times in order for it to register what I am saying. Sound quality is good but not as good as the older generation echos. It’s heavy on the bass which I had to tone down in the settings app.

I had an issue with this Echo at first but Amazon proactively reached out when I left my last review and it’s been resolved.

I like the look, the sound quality is good, what I don’t like and I think is important is I have to yell to wake it up.... I don’t know if I can adjust that..but it’s frustrating to have to keep yelling ALEXA, ALEXA, to wake it up...the last generation one pick up your voice even with noise.

Just unboxed my new echo and so far so good. It’s a bummer that the power cord is white. Maybe it’s not a big deal but my original echo had a black cord that camouflaged on the counter nicely.

Totally impressed with the device setup (device acquired and configured network), improved sound quality, hub, and temp sensor.

I traded in my original 1st generation Echo for this 4th generation unit because there were some very enticing trade in promotions.  I totally regret doing it.Looks:  the 4th generation looks much nicer than previous models, especially this Twilight Blue model.Sound: sound is good, but I keep this unit in the center of the my apartment, so front-firing speakers are not good.Performance:  This model's microphone array is not nearly as sensitive or performant as the 1st generation. I often have to raise my voice and repeat myself to get the Echo to do what I want it to do. . .or my 3rd Gen Echo Dot which is 2x the distance away from me will hear the command.  I rarely had to do this with the 1st generation model.  I really cannot wait until a next generation model comes out with decent microphone performance so I can trade this in.Update:  Customer Service or Technical Support saw this review and called me within a few hours of my post.  They suggested that I changed the wake word and then restart the Echo, but there was no improvement.  Kudos for paying attention, but this feels like a hardware/design flaw at the moment.

Great version of the Echo. I just replaced my 1st gen with this in the guest bedroom.  The table is glass, so the blue activity light looks really cool.

I wanted to love this product. I bought two to use with my fire stick as a home theater option. It worked for 3 days then simply stopped working. The speakers would pair,but wouldn’t play sound. Individually the speakers would work, but when paired (any way) no sound would come out. I reset and started from square one multiple times on each product and it never worked again. To top it off, I had 3 30min-60 min conversations with Alexa help desk where they tried the exact same solutions, wrote a trouble ticket and said they would call me back with a solution. I spoke with 3 separate people who never called back… the first phone call was over a week ago, so I gave enough time.I have now returned the products and am been reluctant to purchase and echo Device again. Apple May have less products to integrate… but at least the ones it has will work. Highly disappointed.

I got the 2nd 3rd and 4th Gen of the Echo and their all great. But if you have the 3rd Gen it's really not worth upgrading to the 4th. It's a bit faster than the 3rd but not that much faster. It has more bass but the sound it's  better. Great gift it's really a coin flip but if you still have the 2nd Gen than yeah upgrade you will notice a hug difference in the sound and speed.

My original Echo finally died and I recently bought this newer/round model. I use use my Echo as an alarm clock/Timer/Reminder. I have it positioned on top of a medium height bookshelf about 10 feet away from where I sleep.  I find I am constantly shouting at my Echo. ""ALEXA, SNOOZE!"" ALEXA! ALEXA! ALEXXXXXXA SNOOZE! It's not the best way to wake up in the morning.I feel like the distance and direction of which you are talking to it matters. If I hang my head off the bed to shout it seems to work better :POtherwise works great to listen to music while I work , reminders and timers.

Echo 4th generation temperature are not working.  It’s will announce the temperature in the house if you ask.  But I want it to setting the temperature routine to trigger the ceiling fan when the room above 74 Fahrenheit to turn the ceiling fan on, it not doing it.  So I call in for tech support several time to get help, I got nothing out of it.  Thought, they did told me the the echo 4th generation are unable to trigger ceiling through temperature control routine.  They say that the echo 4th gen only can tell the temperature in the if you ask but that is it.  But when I read on the echo 4th gen routine it clearly stated that through routine it can be set to activate ceiling fan when the temperature above or below certain degree automatically without have to manually gone through Alexa app to turn it on.  Do anyone have echo 4th gen have the issue?  The experience I have with technical support are very unpleasant, she is rude, and she hang up the phone on me.  I have been using google home and think about switching to Alexa but now due to the unpleasantly rude and unwillingly to work helping to fix the issue.  Hmm maybe switching to Amazon Alexa devices are not the way to go.  That’s it just too bad.

The sound quality on the Alexa 4th Gen. is FANTASTIC and I absolutely love the new design. What I cannot understand is: WHY would Amazon change the color of the cord to WHITE instead of the black (or even gray) like the previous generations?

I am really (and pleasantly) surprised by the quality of sound the 4th Gen Echo produces! I bought this as a companion to my laptop, just to get a little extra sound from Spotify while I work.

As of August 31, 2021, Sylvania Osram will discontinue their Lightify app. So no more using the app on your phone to control your garden lights (color, intensity, timer, etc.). However, using this Echo with Zigbee, they hope by September 1, 2021, you will have some of the controls back (without their app). At $79, this Echo is the least expensive with intregated Zigbee which is required for communication with the Lightify lights.

This little black orb meets expectations, with one exception: classical music. It doesn't respond well to requests for complete symphonies by specific conductors. It says that movements from symphonies are ""songs"". That's not the Echo's fault - it's the software behind it. But, if you call up a symphony from Amazon Music on your Alexa app, then it plays via Bluetooth. Otherwise, it sounds great and has a huge and diverse listening catalog.

Did not meet expectations for a new generation model.  Poor voice recognition as compared to previous models.  I often have to repeat commands speaking louder and/or moving closer.

Definitely sounds better musically. Assume that's due to the tweeter addition and better dispersion. Good bass response. An upgrade from my 2nd Gen.

Not much larger than a softball, the 4th generation Echo produces an astonishing range of sound. The treble is not much of an improvement on the Dot (which was, by itself, capable of remarkable sound for its size), but the low end of the Echo is what surprises. Warm and clear, the mellow parts of vocals and orchestrations are immediately identifiable and welcome. I bought it on the basis of this promise and I am not disappointed.

I have crappy 2nd and 3rd gen Dots. I can't stand how they sound on their own, so I use 3rd party speakers, which greatly improve the quality. The speaker base for the 2nd gen has been fritzing, so I thought why not spend more money for a single product that should work better and hopefully sound as good.Well, friends, it does not sound as good. I don't know if I have a bum unit — I don’t think I do — but Alexa's voice sounds awful. Podcasts are fine, and music is fine — not great, but fine, and so much better than her voice, which is why I don't think it's a bum unit. Alexa's voice is so muddy it's almost un-understandable. I'm returning it. I'll just get a new Bluetooth speaker to go with my old Dot.

The biggest issue I have had so far is the unit not finding the server or loosing the WI-FI signal. Its not my router cause I have other WI_FI assets that show 100 %  connectivity when Alexa starts having issues, an orange ring starts glowing until it resolves itself, at a times it will go for an hour attempting to fix it self, get this resolved and all would be good to go.

The first few months I had this I don't recall ever having to reset the device(pulling power cord out and in).Now about every week it will light up letting me know it heard ""Alexa,"" but never respond and eventually go back to sleep. No smart switch commands will execute or anything, the only fix is to reset it. This is a major problem when I've set an alarm or reminder and Alexa now won't activate those alarms/reminders.And no... This has nothing to do with my internet. I have 1:1 gb fiber. Also I'm a software engineer with a part time job as a server administrator. I know my network and machines better than anyone, and this device is simply screwing up.

I read previous reviews, but decided to try it on my own. I am very pleased with the entire Echo 4th Generation. The sound quality is excellent. The voice recognition has been almost flawless.

Not sure the upgrade is worth paying for a new version but it is certainly better looking than the original tower.

This attractive little Echo Alexa (blue ball) looks great on my kitchen counter.  Also, it (she?) is responsive and helpful, giving me ideas of what I can add and how she can help.  I also get emails giving me suggestions of questions to ask and how to connect her to my phone and TV.  Great product.

Not worth the money. Older first gen Echo and Echo Dots all work. This sounds great but no groups or devices work properly. Waste of money and will be returning.Edit: Hard reset after initial set up and multiple reboots seems to have corrected most of the issues after a couple weeks of stress.

I used to love these devices, but in the last year she's always adding at the end of every command i give her ""by the way ..."". I don't want to here her suggestions or tips or anything. I just want her to do what I asked her to do. I have followed every suggestion I can find on the internet and nothing works. Just tonight she was telling me she can get me ready for the rings of power. Amazon should not be advertising their things in my home like that. They should leave it on their Fire TV and website. I don't need to hear about it when I want to turn my lights off or set a timer. Never buying another amazon smart home device.

The room-filling sound is obviously a result of expertly chosen drivers precision-tuned to YOUR room. I've heard one of the ""Studios"" and this speaker is as good if not better. Plan on replacing all my ""3rd Gen's"" & 2 ""2nd Gen"" (Yes, I've been at this a while) with these ""4th Gen Premiums"". Can't wait to hear my house with ALL ""4th Gen Premiums"". Thanks, Amazon! It's been exciting watching Alexa grow & evolve. Keep it up!Jim, in NC

The only thing I can compare my  Gen 4 to is my Gen 1.I like the twist volume on top of the Gen 1.The gen 4 seems to have a better bass sound.Other than that they are about the same.Of course, neither has the sound quality of a more expensive speaker system.

I wanted to move the Echo on the Kitchen Island into the spare bathroom so I could hear music up in the quiet part of the house, add some music up there. So I purchased this for the Kitchen island and absolutely love it.  We have 5 echos in our home including the Echo Show. It arrived quickly and was packaged extremely well.

Ok I came from having a 2 gen echo and now I decided to go to the 4 gen Echo. The echo 4 gen sounds a bit more especially the subwoofer but unless you want to use it in pair with another echo. you should reconsider or buy 2 echo dots 4 gen and use them in soundgroup.

I really dislike this new shape. Alexa has more trouble hearing me, and I cannot see the blue bar at the bottom when I am just a little bit away. The taller shape made it easy to see the light (blue or otherwise) from anywhere in the room (no, there isn't a better place to put it) and I had far less trouble with Alexa hearing me. Short and round is not a good design for this. It affects the sound as well, as the speakers are lower. Putting my two new ones where I don't use them much, and putting my 3rd generation back where these are! Sound is good with this 4th generation, but I can't tell a significant difference between the two.

My 3yr old son likes to talk to Alexa and sometimes when I'm listening to something he interrupts my music to ask her to play something he likes. Alexa does a very very good job in playing what he wants, including when he's not very specific and he wants to play save your tears by the weekend and he tells her ""Alexa play tears the weekend""

This new Echo is better than previous echo’s. The sound sounds a bit more bossy to me but still very good for most music. The voice recognition doesn’t seem to work as easily as before but still not bad. All in all the new shape allows for some better changes so its a good improvement for us. Not theater quality but its not meant to be.

I was so happy with the easy set up because I had a few apps connected to my older version. It was super easy to connect them all to this one.

I've had my Echo now for about three weeks and really like it.  I don't claim to be an audiophile but I have a good ear for sound and music and I'm very pleased with the sound quality. Also, the selection of music on Amazon Music seems almost limitless.  I almost always easily find what I want. I'm 100% pleased. I like some of the other features too but I bought it mainly to listen to music.

The one closest to me will play deaf on occasion. The one on the opposite side of the room will on occasion respond, but it seems the older echo’s (generation before this) now relocated to the kitchen and bedroom (approximately 20 feet away in either direction) seem to respond to commands better than the two new ones, I never had this issue with my older ones. They’ve all been reassigned locations under the Alexa app. Strange to hear the Echo’s in the kitchen and bedroom respond to commands compared to the one within arm reach.A LOT better sound than the previous generation though, not to Bose quality but a lot better!

This is our second echo, the first generation model we had finally died. We rarely played music with it, preferring our two dots, each of which was paired to a Doss stereo speaker set. But with the latest Echo we are finding the sound quality so improved we use it as our main music device for streaming.

I love the new Echo 4th Gen, the sound, volume control & voice recognition is all great. The only thing that needs improvement is the ring light, it’s difficult to see when it’s on. I did order a holder for the wall in hopes that I see it better since I can place it higher on the wall. I haven’t received it yet otherwise I would let you know if it fixed my one issue.

A definite improvement over the previous generation echo.  When i played music from it it was way better sound than the previous generation (although if you want that low end bass feel/hit, pair it with a good sub). It does seem to respond better with commands and such. So far everything i have done to get my smart home going has been a breeze.

Let me start by saying if the replacement speaker sounds better, I’ll change my 2-star review.We have a household full of Echo Dots, of various generations.  I finally decided to buy the full sized Echo for our living room, as we often play music and other things as a family in this room. I was excited to have better speaker quality and was willing to pay a little more for it.After 2 days, we noticed the sound would crack, in addition to everything sounding a bit muffled. I tried adjusting the equalizer to reduce bass, assuming that was the cause of the muffled sound, but no dice. Still sounded like it was behind a door or under water.  Not to mention, the random crackles of sound.Amazing was great, and offered a replacement over Support Chat. But… the replacement sounds just as poorly out of the box.We’ve got a third device coming - I’m not giving up yet (so many good reviews, right??) but I’m not optimistic.  As of this moment, the 3 year old Echo Dot we had in here before had clearer sound and better voice recognition.  Yikes Amazon….

Very nice device! I would love to have given it 5 stars, but the voice / command recognition is below par. I sometimes find myself yelling at it, before it finally wakes up to follow directives. The neighbors must think I'm out of my mind!! Also, when I for example ask about the wind speed of certain regions, it's never gotten it right once. It's generally lower, off by at least 10 mph! I always have to revert to asking Google which gets it right. I hope Amazon will do an update for at least the voice recognition. That would be awesome, since otherwise it works pretty well with the attached smart devices, once it finally wakes up!

Got this hoping to pair it with a 3dr gen as a stereo pair. Unfortunately, you can only pair same generation identical units as stereo pairs (makes sense).  So I just made it a speaker group.  Definitely sounds better than the 3rd gena and the spherical shape looks very up to date. Added bonus the smart home feature quickly found my printer and added as a smart home device allowing easy printing of lists.

I traded in my 3rd gen charcoal for a 4th gen of the same color. When I started unpacking the device I figured there must have been a mistake since the cord was white. After chatting with Amazon support and looking at reviews for the device I realized this was intended. I could perhaps see why a twilight or red variant might not come with a matching cord, but it doesn’t make sense to me why the charcoal wouldn’t come with a black cord.The echo otherwise is excellent. The sound quality is improved upon the prior generation with the additional tweeter. The new shape seemed different at first but it doesn’t bother me at all anymore and it looks nice. If it came with a matching cord and considering the price I picked it up at, it would be a 5 star product.
","Negative"

I love the sound and certainly the add-on battery base I purchased separately. Wasn’t hard to setup and get linked into my account and system.Love how I’m able to connect by Bluetooth to my Bluetooth enabled projector so the sound will come out of the Alexa.Just don’t understand why they supply a white cord instead of a black one.

Not really an upgrade from gen 3. The audio is excellent. Very crisp. But the mic is not as accurate as the gen 3. I often find myself repeating myself several times before this unit gets it right. It works, but I hope they do some software updates to correct this.

Having a house-full of dots (3rd gen), this was a nice upgrade, but obviously not the best echo product.  I look forward to continuing to upgrade devices where this is the lowest model I have around the house.  It looks fantastic and has a really smooth bass.  That said, it's not perfect, and I have to restart it from time to time because the mic stops working.

I wanted to replace a 2nd Gen Dot with a full size Echo.  It was just when the pre-order for Echo 4th Gen opened.  I figured, ""Sure!  This will be good!""  Unfortunately I was very, very wrong.I, like other purchasers, have the issue of poor microphone sensitivity.  I find myself repeating ""Alexa"" about 3 times before it wakes up.  I'll give it a command and it will just wait in limbo until I repeat the command.Additionally, like other purchasers,  I don't like that it came with a white power cord.  It looks stupid with a charcoal unit.The sound quality is AWFUL!  I believe part of the issue is that the speaker is angled from 1/2 way up the front to the base of the back.  The rest of the top is just plastic, not speaker.  I didn't think about it at the time but it's a stupid design.  Sound is being pushed out and down.  Perhaps if I put it on a high shelf it would sound better but should I HAVE to place it on a high shelf to be able to hear it properly?Interestingly, I was charged full price for the ""free"" Philips bulb that was included with the pre-order.  I hadn't actually noticed until just the other day.  So they screwed me on that.I would have returned the Echo 4th Gen but, like an idiot, I threw away the box before I realized how bad a product it is.  So it's pretty much a paperweight now.Save yourself the aggravation and skip this one.

Because of this purchase, we have bought 1 more 4th gen and 2 4th gen dots.

We replaced an Echo Dot with this, mostly to benefit from the indoor temperature feature. But really, the Dot did pretty much everything we wanted - except for indoor temperature. So, kinda feel we wasted some money on the upgrade. If you don't really need to know the indoor temperature, and aren't overly picky about audio quality, the Echo Dot will fill the need.

I have all of the previous Echo generations in the house. This one works very well and probably does sound the best - I use it for music a lot. So, I’m happy with it.However, the design is terrible.

I was super excited to upgrade my echo dot 3 to the new Echo! I now regret that decision immensely!! I mean, yes the sound quality is a LITTLE better than the dot 3 but not enough to justify the hefty price tag and it not recognize my voice within 3 feet. Heck, even my echo dots pick up what I am saying and they are in the other side of the apartment

Love this new design. I upgraded to this new echo for the better sound quality to play music on. I was amazed at how well it sounds and love all the different ways it is integrated into our home.

We have an older model that actually is more receptive when we ask to listen to the news, or ask it to shut down, etc. Often I have to repeat ""Alexa"" several times to get it to follow a command... don't know what that is all about BUT the sound quality of the speaker when we listen to music is excellent.

This was to be used as the primary sound/music system in our townhouse.  Bought a Wonderboom speaker to pair with it based upon online reviews.  I still can't pair it with Echo.  Wonderboom pairs fine with my iPhone, iPad, but when I ask Alexa to ""Pair"" I always get the same response - no devices detected.  I've tried pairing through the app but the instructions are incomplete and poorly written, and it still doesn't work.  If you just want a standalone Echo it is fine, but if you want it to be the basis of a broader sound system, be prepared for lots of frustration!

I love my little echo.  It has a mighty sound.  I could be in the next room and echo recognizes my voice when I give a command.  This sounds really good and crisp.  I enjoy listening to my echo when I choose to hear news or music.  I would highly recommend this  for any age group.  I would put this in my office or bedroom.

Bought this to replace an Echo Plus cylinder unit that is connected to a sub woofer. That original configuration worked and sounded great. Suddenly with that one playlists would no longer consistently play, if at all. So, bought this 4 gen device thinking it would be comparable or better than the EP. Unfortunately, the sound is not as good and unit does not “listen” as well either. Have bought many of these devices since they hit the market. This is the first time being disappointed by one. It’s a step back- what a disappointment.

Wifey wanted music in the bedroom, so moved my third gen Dot to the bedroom and bought the fourth gen Echo to upgrade the sound quality in the family room. It sounds much more like a stereo system compared to the Dot, which wasn't that bad to begin with. I am also surprised how much I appreciate the echo's faster response times. It's actually easily discernible.

Sonido excelente, mejor volumen que el dot 3, aunque el reconocimiento de voz  es mejor en DOT3.Cuando tienes 2 dispositivos DOT tienes la opción  de poner música  en  todas partes, y suena en los 2 dispositivos al mismo tiempo.  Solo ppr el reconocimiento de voz le doy 4 estrellas.

Voice recognition is a little weak but the sound quality makes up for it. Take advantedge of the tech support. I logged a ticket and got a call in less than 5 minutes. Absolutley unexpected and outstanding sound. I paired two 4th Gen Echos and subwoofer. Better than the $700 sound system I had in place. There seems to be an issue with the surround sound settings. If you adjust the audio settings on the Firestick to level the sound the speakers disconnect and you have to reboot the system. EXTREMELY ANNOYIING. Almost enough so that i want to return them. Can't say for sure the the latest Firestick is part of the problem as well. All system updates are current. Check out all settings before you lync up your other smart devices.

You could do many things with the 4th generation echo, but I mainly bought it for listening to music on spotify and the amazon music apps.

Overall I like the 4th generation echo.

I have several older Echos and they seem to work way better than this one.  It has gone completely unresponsive several times (Won't respond to ""Alexa"" commands).  I have to reboot it to resolve.  Also, have it paired with my Mac Mini as an external speaker.  Sound over Bluetooth cuts out regularly and is very cracky.  Mac works fine with any other Bluetooth speaker I have, so I'm sure it's the Echo.  Connecting over Bluetooth goes unresponsive at least once a week.  Have to reboot and re-pair to get it to work again.  I've been very pleased with all other Echo devices I have... but, this one is really letting me down.

It sometimes needs to be told twice to do something, but I’m used to that with my Echo Show 8 and occasionally other echo devices.

Sounds good when paired with another Gen 4 and a sub but it’s pretty flakey. Sometimes it hears you and sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes it understands you and sometimes it doesn’t. It does this thing when you tell it to stop playing music where it stops the music then plays a second of the music again then stops, kinda like when you old Ford Pinto diesels after you turn the engine off. I hope it’s just some software issues and not a physical design flaw. I invested in 4 of these plus 2 subs to cover music in the entire house.

I call her Angel's Bomba because her color and shape remind me of a cartoon bomb, minus the fuse.Room-filling sound, though the bass can get muddy, but can be adjusted using the Alexa app equalizer.Compact size fits most anywhere, but it's currently on the kitchen counter.

Purchased a set of Gosund light switches to go with the echo and I can remotely turn lights on and off with one simple command or turn on the lights with the Alexa app when not at home.

Hope Amazon tech can do some hardware updates to fix it.

Such a wonderful gift this was. I can now have Alexa work my hue Phillips lights throughout my home. I can now have Alexa turn my heat up or down on my thermostat and she also tells me to have a great day when I’m leaving out for work. The sound is great when I’m playing all my latest hits.

I have a gen 1 google mini. I have just purchased this echo because I like how much 3rd party support Alexa has vs. Google and I use Amazon a ton. I also own a google phone. I figured I would get the Alexa with premium sound because surely that's better than a Google mini Gen 1.Setting up the Alexa is breeze. I still think it lacks simple recognition vs. Google.Sound quality - even with the ""premium sound"" version the Google mini still sounds better to me. I have them both right next to each other for comparison. Google is way better and works with my tidal which Alexa does not. I'm not an Audiophile but I still think Gen 1 Google mini is better. Fills the room better and has better bass. To test the sound between the two I used siriusxm symphony hall. Sad I wanted Alexa to be more. I was really hoping for more.Future proof? - not sure who will be the better long term investment but for now Google offers a little more for less. I really wanted Alexa to knock my socks off, but it just fell flat for me. For the price of Alexa Echo premium sound you can get two mini's.Sorry.

We upgraded from our set of 2nd Gen Echos to these, and they are improved in every way. I'm personally a big fan of the ball shape, though I realize not everyone is.

It's a little frustrating that I almost have to yell ""Alexa"" for the Echo to wake up, but maybe it's just my voice and/or the positioning of the Echo. The 4th Gen Echo seems to have a pretty good sound and the sound is a bit more powerful than the 2nd Gen Echo.

This makes no sense.  We purchased a black echo for a reason.  So it would blend in on our black counter with black backsplash.  Now we have a big, white plug and white cord sticking out like a ""sore thumb.""  Why can't you send a black cord with a black echo???

It randomly announces that it’s connecting to my laptop, etc. and I contacted support only to find out that can never be turned off.

However, it I believe it had a faulty microphone array. I would be a ft or two feet far away and it would take 3-4 times me saying ""Alexa"" for it to hear me! I am not kidding. Sometimes, the older echo (which would be in the room next door ) would hear me and perform the command instead of this 4th gen, even when literally next to it. I am not sure if this was a defective unit, I think it works great as a simple bluetooth speaker but as an Alexa device it failed at recognizing ANY voice close-by.

I'm amazed at the sound that is produced from this small dome! Great job!

Mostly listen to music. Very good sound for the classics to contemporary.

It definitely is an upgrade over the Dot in terms of sound. Got a good deal for it on Prime Day, so great for its price.But my primary reason for buying it was for the Zigbee hub function. Now I have a lot more choices for home automation devices. Definitely worth the price.

Does OK.  I think Google's Nest hub is better in design, voice recognition and in integration  but it is also personal preference.Google's grouping of devices is more logical and was cleanly laid out.  I have both available in main parts of the house

This is exactly what we were looking for! Sounds great and works as expected!!

Quality sound and easy to interact with Alexa

Finally, I can listen to music while I'm cooking/baking or relaxing with a cup of tea.  Love the joke of the day too.  The sound quality is excellent in my opinion.  The white cord doesn't bother me at all and it's not a huge clash with the blue/grey color I ordered.  Overall, very satisfied with my Echo.

If you don't mind Alexa listening in, this is the perfect speaker.  I have several around my house.  (I don't fret the eavesdropping-not too many elicit events around here.).  We have one cylindrical one in the kitchen but I wanted a separate handsfree device for myself.  I am picky about sound but NOT a musical prodigy.  Sound is clean and strong.  Very happy.

Alexa is great, but sound quality is disappointing at the price point.

The sound quality on this Alexa what is far superior to previous versions.  My only complaint is they put the light on the bottom of the sphere so when it goes off you can never see the light
","Positive"
"
Poor sound quality. Yes, it has bass, but no matter how it was adjusted the sound quality was muddy.

I have really enjoyed this Alexa Echo.  The sound is great and it's so easy to listen to the music I enjoy.  I have also used the multiple timers when cooking and the reminders I can set.  I'm amazed at how often I use Alexa.  It was a gift from my daughter and I love it!  Easy to use for seniors.
","Positive"
"
The only negative thing I have to say is that the echo is much larger than expected. Like the size of a cantaloupe/melon.But overall, the device is awesome. My little ones loves talking to Alexa and here her jokes. Playing music and asking other commands like volume control or using her as a timer/alarm makes things much easier. I’m excited to purchase other devices to make the experience even better.

Great speaker! Sounds great, looks great, and works as it's supposed to.

"
No problems with setup. No problems with device integration. A helpful and fun device.

Great sound!! Get a rechargeable base so you can take it outside. Love the Echo Line !!!
","Positive"
"
We love our Alexa!  The sound quality is great!  This is our 2nd one!!
","Positive"
"
I particularly like its ability to play music, give me the daily news, hone in on another room, and the sound is good for the music and voice selections.  Hoping we can use it on a larger scale for other activities as we learn more uses and functions and capabilities.

I have had one of each generation of Echo and this is my favorite so far. The sound is terrific and the ability to act as a hub for our smart home devices is terrific. It's a little big so we just ordered the mounting bracket to get it up and off the countertop.
","Positive"
"
I got these because of the ""premium"" sound quality. I have had an echo spot for several years and the sound quality ov the 4th generation is much better. I have experienced two annoying issues, the first is the sound became muffles after a few weeks almost like listening to a mini AM radio. After cycling the power the muffled sound went away and all has been normal since. My second issue is the microphones on these devices (I purchased 2) are no where near as good as my spot. In fact while in my kitchen next to the 4th gen when I say the wake word it does not respond but the spot that is down the hall in my kids room hears me and responds. I hope this is a software issue that will be fixed soon.

Just commenting on the design.  We have 4 previous generation Echos.  I've always liked the physical hardware design - the canisters and the puck.  But IMHO the new spheres are the most attractive yet.  The indicator lights that used to rim the top are now around the base and make a glow on the surface underneath - clever and elegant.
","Positive"

Looks cool, sounds great. Had 1st Gen for 4 years, this 4th Gen is a great update. I recommend.
","Positive"
"
It is what I expected with a great sound quality (for its price)
","Positive"
"
Excellent addition to Alexa network of devices. Easy setup and integration and full bass sound.
","Positive"

Going to purchase a second one, can’t wait to pair them up. One has a great room filling sound.
","Positive"
"
Super easy to set  up.
","Positive"

I felt why I didn't get it before it is a must-have item and made many things easier to remember. we have been using it to add stuff to the grocery list, reminders, alarms, and whatnot...the voice clarity is amazing and is super helpful around the house, and helps in keeping things organized
","Positive"
"
The installation directions were a little too simplistic so it took us awhile to get it set up ( my Amazon Dot was a lot simpler) but when we finally got it online we were quite pleased. It fills the living room with sound the way that our stereo speakers do. But it is a lot easier to move it from one location to another then our stereo system.
","Positive"
"
The sound quality is excellent however it takes an average of three to four voice callings for it to finally recognize and acknowledge your voice much worse voice recognition then my older generation Alexa.
","Negative"
"
I actually like the sound of the previous gen better. This one is a bit boomy. The base makes her a bit harder to understand and I seem to have to say the trigger word louder...which the paranoids in the house like. Otherwise works as intended.
","Positive"
"
I love the new Echo. Especially coming from the second gen Echo Dot. The sound and design are great. The only thing is, the microphone doesn’t seem to pick up my voice as well when activating Alexa. And it doesn’t stay on as long when giving a command. Not too big of an issue for me though. It’s still worth the buy.
","Positive"
"
It was so easy to set up and fun to use😊

It is incredible what you can do with this thing! And the voice recognition is crazy good.

It’s kook it does what it’s suppose to

Significant improvement in sound quality from the Gen  2 tower I had. Sphere is fine, no issues with style or look. Only drawback so far is it is less sensitive to commands. I need to speak louder and a little more clearer when standing a bit further from it.
","Positive"
"
Love it. I have it turn on and off wall plugs, lights and tvs and more.
","Positive"

The phone app has some sort of glitch. Sometimes The app won t open. I just get a white screen.

I use this product for weather, music, amazon shopping. It's quick and easy.

Love Aleza ❤️

I've been using it for about a ,month the sound quality is excellent and the integration with the thermostate and lights is great
","Positive"

My initial purchase had to be replaced (courtesy of Amazon) after 6 months of operation due to WiFi connectivity issues. The replacement unit appears to be working well. It is connected to Smart Bulbs, contact sensors, Sonos Speakers, and Smart TV. So far so good.

I like the fact that I don’t need to get up to turn out lights. It’s sometimes hard to understand instructions for me.

Works great!  The kids love it to help them with spelling

Easy to set up, great sound and I love it!

Skills are well developed and voice recognition is amazing.

I traded my original Echo tower for this new model.  The sound is a big improvement.  I have a small apartment and this allows me to use my music apps for better sound quality.  I do not mind the shape.  It took a while for it to recognize my voice everytime.  I recommend the Echo 4. Give it a try.

Lo uso para casi todo, ella disfruta las conversaciones y de hacer cuentos

4 stars only because the sound isn't great. I have a second gen echo that sounds much cleaner. This one is muddy af compared. But overall, cool device.

Got as a gift, I love it! Definitely going to get the subwoofers.

"
So far so good.  No issues yet.  Loving my birthday/Christmas gift!

Bought this to make a stereo pair and all the stereo pair will work with is fire tv  that is trash to begin with.This is the last amazon anything I will be returning or purchasing. Companies thinking they can cripple products to force you into an ecosystem should be run out of business.

We’ve traveled for the past 20 years so didn’t know about these til we came back.  Our daughter has one and we thought it was a hoot so we got one when we moved into our new home.  Highly... highly recommend.  Not only valuable information can be obtained by asking... but it’s a hoot
","Positive"

Exactly what I expected. Great sound quality with  Amazon music
","Positive"

Subwoofer is nice
","Positive"

Loved the sound and the ease of operation.  I used to have to find  disc/record/tape and manage the device in which I place it/them.  Now - I just say ""Alexa"" - and she does the work.
","Positive"
"
I love my Alexa especially for music the sound is fantastic and love that She'll play any song I'm in the mood for. But she is also great at answering questions, weather, reminders and so much more. I need a couple more.

i decided between homepod mini and this one buy it because Black Friday but not regret

I  miss the notification light ring on the top of the Echo Plus 3rd gen.  On the 4th gen it is down at the bottom and is not visible  unless you are almost on top of it. They should have figured out how to keep the light ring at the top.

I like that you can connect with smart devices around the house

Upgraded  from regular echo dot puck style  - loved the bass...
","Positive"
"
I love the new ball shape. Its pretty and the kids love looking at it. The bass is damn good. Have to turn it down a little to hear Alexa speaking though. I love the drop-in feature. Overall, the commands are great and it was easy to pair with my account. Highly recommend.
