• Developed software (nltk, speech recognition) converts multilingual speech to text and text to speech in 6 different languages

• Performed text summarization on transcribed text, it included feature representation using word embeddings (Glove)

• Utilized page rank algorithm to order phrases based on weights assigned during features representation

Utilized API's such as Speech Recognition and Google Text to Speech (gtts); transcribed speech and vice versa.

Implemented NLP applications i.e. extractive summarization of text, which involved preprocessing such as tokenization, POS tagging, and syntactical analysis of the transcribed text.
